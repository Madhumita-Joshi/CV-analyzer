29,HR,"b'HOW TO WRITE A PROFESSIONAL RESUME\n\n\x0c\x0cRESUME TIPS\nThe following tips are suggestions that you should consider when writing and sending your resume to prospective\nemployers:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nUse white or light colored paper in standard size (8 \xc2\xbd x 11 inches). Many office supply stores sell resume paper.\nBe sure to include a cover letter with mailed and emailed resumes. When you email a resume and cover letter,\ncreate a short introduction to use as your email body.\nThe resume should be easy to read, crisp, and have a consistent format.\nAlways keep your resume up-to-date!\n\nMany companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS), which scan resumes for key words and themes that\nmatch the job description. These words identify skills that the company is looking for to fill specific job postings. However,\ndue to the use of this software, there are specific ways a resume should be formatted so that it will scan properly in to the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s system.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nDo not use a template, invisible text boxes, special graphics, color, or shading. Always use a blank Microsoft Word\ndocument to create a text-only version of your resume for online submissions. Always submit your resume in a .pdf\nformat and save more creative versions of your resume to hand to an employer in person.\nUse standard, non-decorative fonts in black ink only. Font sizes should be 14-16pt for your name and 10-12pt for\nthe body of your resume.\nMargins should be equally set between .6 \xe2\x80\x93 1 inch on all sides.\nAvoid folding or stapling your resume. If your resume is more than one page, create a header and/or footer with\nyour name, contact information, and page number.\n\nKey words describe skills using nouns and action verbs and are very important in your resume. Companies usually\nindicate key skills they are looking for in the job posting.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nUse synonyms in your resume \xe2\x80\x93 if you use the word, \xe2\x80\x9cAttorney\xe2\x80\x9d, also use the word, \xe2\x80\x9cLawyer\xe2\x80\x9d.\nDo not use \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cmy\xe2\x80\x9d, or other personal pronouns \xe2\x80\x93 simply begin statements with strong action verbs to\ndescribe what you did.\nKey words = experience + knowledge (be honest and do not exaggerate your skills).\n\nAlways proofread your resume before you send it!\n\n\x0cOBJECTIVES\nAn objective statement is a one or two line statement of your career or job search goal. It is used in place of a longer\nsummary, likely when a candidate has little to no experience related to their target position. Your objective should be\nspecific to the type of position or field that you\xe2\x80\x99re applying to and focus on what you can contribute to the position or\ncompany, not what you want or what you can gain from the experience.\nNOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY \xe2\x80\x93 DO NOT COPY.\n\nManagement:\nSeeking an entry-level management position with responsibilities including problem-solving, planning, organizing, and\nmanaging budgets.\nAdmin:\nAn administrative position in the area of rehabilitation and geriatric healthcare, utilizing knowledge of clinical, community,\nand patient services.\nTeaching:\nA position as an Elementary School Teacher that will utilize strong teaching abilities to create a nurturing, motivational, and\nstimulating learning environment to help children achieve their potential.\nCriminal Justice:\nSeeking a full-time position in the field of criminal justice where education, initiative to succeed, and desire to serve will be of\nvalue in administering and safeguarding criminal and judicial processes.\nTech Support:\nPosition utilizing training and hands-on experience in MIS, help-desk services, technical support, and customer service.\nAccounting:\nSeeking entry-level position as a Staff Accountant utilizing outstanding analytical, accounting, and leadership skills.\n\n\x0cSUMMARIES\nA summary takes the place of an objective statement when a candidate has relevant experience in the field to which they\nare applying. A summary is longer than an objective and highlights the desired position and a few relevant qualifications.\nNOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY \xe2\x80\x93 DO NOT COPY.\nSamples are based on examples presented in \xe2\x80\x9cModernize Your Resumes and Cover Letters\xe2\x80\x9d by Wendy Enelow and Louise Kursmark of The\nResume Writing Academy and Career Thought Leaders Consortium.\n\nMODERN STYLE:\n\nHealth and Social Service Manager\n\nMental Health Program Coordinator \xe2\x94\x82 Social Worker Case Manager\nBilingual (English-Spanish) healthcare leader delivering top-notch health and social service outreach in rural and\nurban communities since 2005\n\nForensic Science Technician\n\nPassion for Science and Discovery\nBS in Biology and Criminology \xe2\x80\x93 Experience collecting, identifying, classifying, and analyzing physical evidence\nthrough classroom projects, criminal investigation internship, and study abroad.\n\nProgrammer Analyst / Software Developer\n\nAnalytical Thinker with 5+ Years\xe2\x80\x99 Experience in the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Industry.\nTechnical Expertise Includes:\nCommand Interpreters \xe2\x80\xa2 MySQL software \xe2\x80\xa2 IEA Software Emerald \xe2\x80\xa2 Microsoft Access\nMicrosoft Visual Basic \xe2\x80\xa2 C++ \xe2\x80\xa2 Python \xe2\x80\xa2 HTML \xe2\x80\xa2 JavaScript\n\nAccounting & Finance\n\nTaxation & Audit \xef\x82\xa7 Financial Planning & Investment\nIntuit QuickBooks \xef\x82\xa7 ERP Software \xef\x82\xa7 Oracle PeopleSoft \xef\x82\xa7 MS Excel \xef\x82\xa7 HR Block Tax Software\nTRADITIONAL STYLE:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Outgoing and articulate, with excellent people skills.

Choose your most impressive courses; try to avoid listing the\nentry-level ones.\nThis section is best paired with the Academic Projects section. Together, both sections are an excellent way to utilize your\ndegree for your job goal.\nTo format the section, simply list your classes using multiple columns. Course numbers, descriptions, and grades are not\nnecessary.\nNOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY \xe2\x80\x93 DO NOT COPY.\n\nTWO COLUMN SAMPLE:\nRELEVANT COURSES\nFinancial Accounting\nCalculus\nMacroeconomics\n\nManagement Accounting\nBusiness Finance\nOrganizational Development\n\nTHREE COLUMN SAMPLE:\nRELEVANT COURSES\nDigital Circuits\nHardware Modeling\nVLSI Design\n\nInformation Security\nAdvanced Systems\nNumerical Analysis\n\nDigital Logic\nComputer Graphics\nAutomata Theory\n\n\x0cACADEMIC PROJECTS\nAcademic projects are used to demonstrate your knowledge of an area or industry when you have little or no experience.\nAnything done in class, except tests, can be presented as a project. Examples include presentations, papers, group work,\ncase studies, and research.\nAll academic projects should be written in active voice using the strongest action verbs possible. In this suggested format,\ninclude a title and keep the overview to two to three lines, providing only enough information so the prospective employer\ncan ask questions. If the project is too in-depth to present in two or three lines, use two or three bulleted statements instead\nof the paragraph format.\nNOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY \xe2\x80\x93 DO NOT COPY.\n\nSoftware Engineering Group Project\nDesigned library catalog web system using 3-tier, client-server model.

Ensured\nmeasurement and layout accuracy through careful architectural research.\n\n\x0cRESULT/ACCOMPLISHMENT STATEMENTS\nResult and accomplishment statements are used when describing previous experience to show the employer written proof\nof your results, achievements, and successes. They demonstrate what is unique about you and how you can add value to a\npotential position by citing specific examples. Simply listing duties or responsibilities from your job description are not\nenough \xe2\x80\x93 focus on what you actually did and how your efforts impacted your position, the project, or organization.\nTo help get you in the mindset of writing result and accomplishment statements, ask yourself some of these questions:\n\xef\x82\xb7 What was the purpose of this work? How was this work relevant to the organization?\n\xef\x82\xb7 What goals was I contributing to? What value or benefit did I add?\n\xef\x82\xb7 How did I go above and beyond basic job duties? Compared to others in my position, how did I stand out?\n\xef\x82\xb7 Did this work save time/money, increase customer satisfaction, design/improve a process or policy, etc? Did I\nachieve more with less; complete something ahead of schedule/budget?\n\xef\x82\xb7 Did I receive a promotion and/or recognition during my employment? Did I consistently maintain or hit above\npersonal or company goals or quotas?\nNOTE: THE FOLLOWING SAMPLES ARE FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY \xe2\x80\x93 DO NOT COPY.\n\nYou can develop result and accomplishment statements using several methods, which are described below:\nSOAR\nStatement of Action \xe2\x80\x93 What did you do?

Skills which can apply to many different jobs or areas are\ncalled transferable skills. They are especially handy to use if you have no relevant work experience or if you are changing\ncareer paths. Incorporating these into your work experience section will help showcase the applicable skills you have to\noffer the employer. Remember, simply listing that you have these skills is not enough. You must include how you used\nthese skills in order to prove you possess them, and show how they are relevant and applicable to the employer.\nBelow is a list of transferable skills to help you get started.\nCommunication\nSpeaking effectively\nListening attentively\nWriting concisely\nEditing\n\nProviding appropriate feedback\nPerceiving nonverbal messages\nFacilitating group discussion\nExpressing ideas\n\nNegotiating and persuading\nSpeaking a foreign language\nReporting information\nDescribing feelings\n\nResearch and Planning\nCreating ideas\nSetting goals\nForecasting\nAnalyzing\n\nExtracting information\nIdentifying resources\nDeveloping strategies\nPredicting outcomes\n\nGathering information\nSynthesizing data\nSolving problems\nDefining needs\n\nHuman Relations\nDeveloping rapport\nBeing sensitive\nCounseling\nAsserting\n\nPerceiving feelings and situations\nProviding support for others\nDelegating with respect\nConveying feelings\n\nRepresenting others\nCooperating\nMotivating\nListening\n\nOrganization, Management, and Leadership\nInitiating new ideas\nDecision making with others\nManaging groups\nDelegating responsibility\nManaging conflict\nSelling ideas or products\nCoaching\nHandling details\n\nCoordinating tasks\nPromoting change\nCounseling\nTeaching\n\nWork Survival\nBeing punctual\nMeeting goals\nCooperating\nOrganizing\n\nAttending to detail\nEnforcing policies\nMaking decisions\nEnlisting help\n\nSetting and meeting deadlines\nImplementing decisions\nAccepting responsibility\nManaging time\n\n\x0cTRANSFERABLE SKILLS: SAMPLES\nHere are some examples of how to use transferable skills to improve on basic job descriptions and prove to the employer\nthat you possess relevant job-related skills.

Where are your thumbs? They are probably at about the midpoint\nof the page. Most employers spend 15 \xe2\x80\x93 30 seconds when first examining r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9, and\nonly seeing the top half of your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9. Therefore, everything above your thumbs\nshould be the most important information that you want to convey to the employer, and\neverything below your thumbs should support the message you are communicating.\nIn this short amount of time employers determine your strengths and if you have\nsomething to offer. If they feel that you do, they will look at your resume in more depth.\nIf not, you will be filed away. You need to make sure that the employer knows what you\nare capable of doing. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t tell them, no one else will. Employers want to\nQUICKLY screen you out. Your goal is to get screened IN.\nHow do you fashion your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 so that it gets noticed? The employer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have\ntime to search your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 for pertinent information \xe2\x80\x93 you must provide it on a silver\nplatter \xe2\x80\x93 easy to obtain and elegantly presented.\nTake the time to craft a r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 that is an accurate reflection of you. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it alone!\nTap into book and web resources, and ask others for input. Remember that you have\nthe final say on your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x99s appearance \xe2\x80\x93 you must like it. When you look at it, you\nshould say, \xe2\x80\x9cWow, I\xe2\x80\x99m good!!\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n1\n\n\x0cWhat is a R\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 ?\nIT IS NOT\n\xc2\x99 Your Autobiography\n\xc2\x99 Your Complete Obituary\nIT IS\n\xc2\x99 A Document Starting Your Professional Credentials\nITS PURPOSE IS\n\xc2\x99 Not to Obtain a job\n\xc2\x99 To Obtain an Interview (YOU get the job)\n\nYour R\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 Is Your Advertisement\nIn most instances your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 is your first contact with an employer. Make sure that it\ngives a positive, professional impression. Your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 is your advertising tool and\nshould provide:\n\xc2\x99 A sense of purpose - Why are you sending the r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9?\n\xc2\x99 Focus on achievements - What separates you from everyone else?\n\xc2\x99 Accuracy - Was it 2003 or 2004? Find out!!\n\xc2\x99 Clarity and Simplicity - This is not the time to try to use the word\nantidisestablishmentarianism in a document.\n\xc2\x99 An attractive package - No jelly or coffee stains, please.\n\xc2\x99 Salesmanship - What measurable facts can you provide?\n\xc2\x99 A sense of person behind the resume -This flat piece of paper needs to sing\nand dance so the employer will want to meet you in person.\n\xc2\x99 Credibility - More than 80% of r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s contain some stretch of the truth. Don\xe2\x80\x99t\ndo this. If you lose your professionalism, it will be nearly impossible to get it back.\n\n2\n\n\x0cWhy Do I Need a R\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 ?\nEmployers are contacted by many applicants and have little time to thoroughly screen\neach applicant. Employers want to know exactly how you can be useful to them without\nhaving to read through excessive or unrelated details. A one page r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 is ideal for\nthose with little experience: two pages are maximum for anyone.\nA r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 should provide a positive impact by being clear, accurate, and relevant to the\njob objective and focused on one industry or employer.\n\xc2\x99 YOU are the best person to write your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9.\n\xc2\x99 In most cases your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 is your first contact with an employer.\n\xc2\x99 Your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 is a communication tool. Effective communication requires you to\nbe responsible for conveying a clear message. If your reader doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get the\ninformation, you didn\xe2\x80\x99t communicate successfully.\n\xc2\x99 Your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 summarizes who you are and what you can do.\n\xc2\x99 Your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 helps the employer decide whether or not to interview you.\n\xc2\x99 Your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 focuses on the employer\xe2\x80\x99s needs, not yours.\n\nTHE 20 SECOND RULE\nThe personnel directors of America\xe2\x80\x99s top corporations say again and again that if you\nhaven\xe2\x80\x99t presented the most important information about yourself in the top half of the\nfirst page of your resume, you can probably forget about getting the job.\nThe head of personnel management for one of the largest and most prestigious employers\nin the Washington, D.C. area told the authors that she allows 20 seconds to scan each\nresume she receives. If in that brief time, she does not see anything that gets her attention,\nshe rejects the resume.\nTaken from The 110 Biggest Mistakes Job Hunters Make by Richard L. Hermann and Linda P. Sutherland\n\nCarry r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s with you when you are canvassing companies for job openings. Submit\nthem with your application materials. When you send a r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 by mail or email,\nalways include a cover letter to identify the job for which you are applying, and why the\nemployer should hire you. Keep copies of your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 in your car and have it available\nat a moments notice.\n\n3\n\n\x0cR\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 Formats\n\nThere are two basic r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 formats that can be used to showcase your talents.\nNeither one is better than the other and both are acceptable. Choose the format that\nyou feel best showcases your abilities.\n\nCHRONOLOGICAL\nThis format is good for people with extensive work experience either with one company\nor a few companies, usually in the field in which they are seeking employment.\nWork and educational experience is listed in reverse order of occurrence beginning with\nthe most recent dates and working back.\nJob duties are listed under the job title, organization and dates.\n\nCOMBINATION\nThis format is good for career changers, those with gaps in employment and those who\nwant to clearly sell specific skills, paralleling the needs of the employer. This format\nallows a person to use skill clusters, while still listing dates, places of employment and\njob responsibilities.\nThis r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 format combines a chronological work experience with skill clusters. The\nwork experience is organized in two separate sections:\n\xc2\x99 A skill clusters section, which highlights major areas of accomplishments from\nprevious employment, training and/or education programs. This allows you to\norganize skills in an order that most supports your job objective.\n\xc2\x99 A chronological listing in reverse order containing job title, organization for which\nyou worked, and dates of employment.\n\n4\n\n\x0cSample Chronological R\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9\nJohn Doe\n222 Market Street\nLewisburg, PA 17837\n570-524-0000\nDoej@aol.com\nOBJECTIVE\n\nTo obtain a position in corporate legal services with ABC Company\n\nEDUCATION\n\nBucknell University, Lewisburg, PA\nBachelor of Arts\nAnthropology\nMay 2005\n\nRELATED EXPERIENCE\nIntern\n1/05-5/05\nKomisarow, Baach & Snouffer, P.C.\nMilton, PA\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Researched new healthcare law\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Balanced firm\'s general ledger, handled press\nreleases and various administrative responsibilities\nTeaching Assistant, Introduction to Law\n8/04-5/05\nBucknell University\nLewisburg, PA\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Evaluated 60 students on weekly papers\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Led class discussions one day per week\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Assisted professor with creating and evaluating exams\nWORK EXPERIENCE\nManager\n11/01-5/03\nLewisburg Freez\nLewisburg, PA\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Trained, reviewed, and supervised 20 employees\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Evaluated and ordered $100,000 inventory\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Balanced four cash drawers and made nightly deposits\nLANGUAGES\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFluent in Spanish\nMicrosoft Office, Macromedia Dreamweaver and Flash, Adobe\nPhotoshop\n\nACTIVITIES\nVolunteer, Sunsine Nursing Home\nMember, Phi Theta Kappa\n\n6/02- present\n8/03 \xe2\x80\x93 present\n\n5\n\n\x0cSample Chronological R\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9\nJane Doe\n1000 Anywhere Street\nAnywhere, NY 10014\n(212) 555-1212\ndoej@hotmail.com\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDynamic, award-winning executive with over 12 years of proven success creating and\nlaunching new products for domestic and international markets.\nLed team of 55 to increase market share by 40%.\nGranted patent for innovative communication tool used to acquire new clients.\nSkilled in reducing marketing costs, managing cross-functional teams, and administering\nmulti-billion dollar budgets.\n\nPROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE\nXYZ Corporation, New York, NY\n2000-present\nDivision Manager, Marketing Strategy and Development\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Direct strategic planning of Internet and high speed access services with $1.7 billion\nannual revenue\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Create, track, and evaluate internal metrics and management reporting to identify\nmarketing performance and effectiveness of programs, markets, and product mix.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Analyze industry trends and competitive landscapes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Oversee opportunity identification and evaluation;

What one person\nlikes, another may not. Ask for a lot of input before deciding on the r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 that is\nright for you.\n\xc2\x99 Keep it to one page unless you have significant experience in your field. If you do\nhave a two page r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9, make sure they are two relatively complete pages.\n\xc2\x99 If you will be moving soon, use the two-address format.\n\xc2\x99 Keep typeface simple. It\xe2\x80\x99s best to use Times-Roman or Arial.\n\xc2\x99 8 1/2"" x 11"" white or light colored, good quality paper is best. Avoid flashy \xe2\x80\x9clook\nat me\xe2\x80\x9d colors. Use matching paper for cover letter and avoid folding your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9\ninto a mailing envelope. Send it in a 9"" x 11"" mailing envelope.\n\xc2\x99 Justify the left margin, but not the right. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to read.\n\xc2\x99 Highlight important information (your name, address, and titles of jobs, major\ncategories) with boldface type.\n\xc2\x99 Use 11 or 12-point type. Do not use graphics unless you are in the design field.\n\xc2\x99 Save it on a computer disk. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to update and/or change this way. Keep\nthe disk safe, and make a back-up copy. Saving your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 also lets you make\ntargeted r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s for specific positions to which you are applying.\n\xc2\x99 Everything you put in your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 is fair game for the interview. Be able to\ndiscuss every point without having to refer to notes or ask for time to respond to\na question.\n\xc2\x99 Bring extra r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s to your interview; even if you are sure your interviewer has a\ncopy.\n\xc2\x99 Use action words (see page 20) when describing what you have done. Examples\ninclude: created, managed, developed, revised, presented, etc.\n\xc2\x99 Proof. Proof. Proof. One mistake generally means you\xe2\x80\x99re out the door. The\nquality of your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 reflects the quality of your work and professionalism. If\nyou make a mistake on your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9, will you make a mistake in your job?\nEmployers will think so.\n\xc2\x99 Remember the 3-Example Rule: If you list a skill, you need to come up with three\nexamples to support it.\n\xc2\x99 Highlight computer/technology knowledge and skills as well as experience\n\nworking as part of a group or team.\n\n11\n\n\x0c12\n\n\x0cParts of the R\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9\nIdentification\nThis section should include your name, address, telephone numbers (home, and/or cell\nphone numbers), and e-mail address. Make sure the employer can reach you, or can\nleave a message easily.\n\nTips\n\xc2\x99 Include area codes with all telephone numbers\n\xc2\x99 Make sure your voice mail message or e-mail address is not offensive,\nunprofessional or \xe2\x80\x9ccutesy\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xc2\x83 Examples of UNPROFESSIONAL emails:\n\xc2\x83 Studmuffin@aol.com\n\xc2\x83 emilyscarletohara@hotmail.com\n\xc2\x83 sexychick@yahoo.com\n\nObjective\nThe objective should tell what you can contribute and demonstrate the value you will\nadd to the organization. The r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 material following the objective should support or\nprove that you can perform the objective. If you have access to a computer, you can\neasily change your job objective to suit each employment opportunity.\nHaving an objective is OPTIONAL. If you choose not to use an objective, make sure\nyou refer to the job you are targeting in your cover letter.\n\nSample Strong Objectives\n\xc2\x99 A position as a General Sales Representative with Eli Lilly which will utilize my\nchemistry and sales background.\n\xc2\x99 A position in data analysis where skills in mathematics, computer programming,\nand deductive reasoning will contribute to new systems development.\n\nSample of Weak Objectives\n\xc2\x99 Management position which will use my business administration degree and will\nprovide opportunities for rapid advancement and annual salary increases.\n\xc2\x99 A public relations position in which I can maximize opportunities to develop and\nimplement programs, organize people and events, communicate positive ideas\nand images.\n\n13\n\n\x0cTips\n\xc2\x99 The objective should be as short as possible, and not include such phrases as\n\xe2\x80\x9cchallenging position\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cutilizing my skills\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cgrowth potential\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9croom for\nadvancement\xe2\x80\x9d, etc.\n\xc2\x99 If you are applying for a specific job opening, always use the employer\xe2\x80\x99s job title\nfor that position.\n\xc2\x99 If you choose not to use an objective, use a summary statement or qualifications\nsection instead.\n\nShowcasing\nThere are two sections of a r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 that are optional, but are excellent ways to\nshowcase your abilities up front. Think of them as a quick snapshot of your best talents.\nThis helps the employer get interested in you quickly!\n\nSummary Statement\nWhen you have a number of years experience in a particular field or industry, this\nstatement is often used as an alternative to an objective or as an addition. It portrays a\nsummary of your credentials in sentence or paragraph form.\n\nExample\nOver ten years of successful experience providing professional customer service.\nProven ability to effectively handle difficult situations. Highly motivated, energetic and\nvery creative.\n\nQualifications\nThis section often appears on the r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 to highlight and summarize your areas of\nexpertise, and your credentials, usually including 3 \xe2\x80\x93 5 lines making reference to your\nWork History, Education and Strengths or Self Management Skills.\n\nExamples\n\xc2\x99 Recently completed my BS degree in Mechanical Engineering\n\xc2\x99 Programming experience in Java, CTT and HTML\n\xc2\x99 Fluent in Spanish and Russian\n\nTips\n\xc2\x99 Put strong statements at the beginning of your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9. The most important\ninformation should come first.\n\xc2\x99 Don\xe2\x80\x99t use the word \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d in any part of your resume.\n\n14\n\n\x0cWorksheet: Showcase Your Accomplishments\nShowcasing your abilities can a challenge, because most of us don\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cbrag\xe2\x80\x9d on a daily\nbasis. However, to successfully communicate your skills to the employer, you need to\nlearn how to \xe2\x80\x9csell\xe2\x80\x9d yourself.\nTake some time to list your accomplishments. Start now, but come back to it later,\nwhen you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought of more things. Draw on all your experiences: paid, unpaid,\nvolunteer, and home. Once you have a list you can pick and choose what you want to\nhighlight.\nThere is no right or wrong way to do this, but try to include as much information as\npossible. If you trained people, how many? The employer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know your\ncapabilities, so your job is to educate him/her on what you can bring to the position!\n\nExamples\n\xc2\x99 Successfully managed $500,000 accounts receivables and reduced delinquent\naccounts by 15 percent.\n\xc2\x99 Trained over 100 staff members in CPR and First Aid procedures.\n\xc2\x99 Developed 35 new accounts while maintaining 60 existing accounts.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nKeep in mind the variety of experiences you have had which can transfer to other job\nduties. Following is a list of some skill areas which may help you categorize your skills.\n\n15\n\n\x0cSkill Clusters\n(Both transferable skills and special knowledge skill areas)\n\nAccountant

should list any training specific to the job desired", as well as your Bucknell\nexperience, noting major fields of study. List diplomas and degrees with your most\nrecent education first and include education in reverse chronological order. Also note\npost graduate and special training courses or seminars you have completed. Cite\nspecial job related skills, such as knowledge of a foreign language or specialized\ncertification.\nIf you are a new graduate with little work experience, you might place your educational\nbackground before your work experience, especially if your recent education or training\nis what qualifies you for the job. On most resumes the education section is placed at the\nend of the resume. You can expand the education section with more details to show\nhow your studies and extracurricular activities relate to the work you seek.\n\nExample\nBucknell University, Lewisburg, PA\nProgram of Study\nDegree Received, date (if within the last 5 years)\n\nTips\n\xc2\x99 Dates are not necessary unless they are favorable to you, I.E. recent\neducation. (You might have to supply them if the employer wants to verify.)\n\xc2\x99 If you have attended or completed college, omit high school.\n\xc2\x99 Include your GPA if it is higher than 3.0. If your major GPA is higher than your\noverall GPA, include it, but indicate that it is your major GPA.\n\n25\n\n\x0cEmployment History\nYou will need to include your job titles, places and dates of employment, and job\nresponsibilities. You may separate your experience into that for which you were paid\nand experience for which you were not paid. Remember, however, that experience is\nvaluable, even if you were not paid to do it.\n\nTips\n\xc2\x99 Don\xe2\x80\x99t go back more than 10-15 years.\n\xc2\x99 Don\xe2\x80\x99t list supervisor contact information. It belongs on a separate reference\nsheet.\n\nAdditional Information\nDO include such things as business, professional, social or civic affiliations; honors and\nawards; and military service.\nOMIT all personal information including marital status, age, state of health, etc. (it is\nillegal for an employer to request that information).\nDo not include this section unless it is pertinent to your qualifications for a particular job\nobjective.\n\n26\n\n\x0cMake Sure you\xe2\x80\x99re resume don\xe2\x80\x99s have mistakes\nby Robert Half\nRobert Half, founder of the California based personnel service Accountemps, has\ncollected r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 bloopers from his Resumania file for more than 40 years.

They are also similar to scannable r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9s; they are reduced to\ndigital form for an employer to search. Traditionally, the r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 focused on visual\naesthetics. The content focused on action verbs and was structured to grab a person\'s\nattention. The focus with an electronic resume is to grab a computer\'s attention. The\nbest electronic r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 is one that is scannable, searchable, and uploadable.\n\nIs Your R\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 Searchable?\nMany companies are requesting that you submit your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 online, totally avoiding the\npaper version. Your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 is directly uploaded into their computers, which, in turn,\nformat your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 to their standards and allow them to search the database. You will\nwant to use key words specific to your field and the position for which you are applying.\n\nElectronic Forms\nThese are typically found on an organization\'s web site. You will be asked to type\ncertain information into blank text boxes and when completed, to click on a button to\nsubmit the information. Sometimes you are given extra space to type a cover letter or a\nsummary of qualifications. In order to utilize electronic forms, you must be using a\nbrowser that will support them, such as Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet\nExplorer.\n\nE-mail\nThis is the most direct method. You can send your r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 as a text-only message or as\nan attachment. Since there are a wide variety of e-mail systems that people use for\nhome and business, you need to make sure that the employer receives your resume.\nReducing your resume to a text-only version such as ASCII (American Standard Code\nfor Information Interchange) is a reliable method. The characters in your resume will be\nuniversally recognized with little room for confusion. Incidentally, electronic forms\nprocess information as ASCII text. To create a good ASCII resume file, you will want to\nremove ALL formatting from your resume (italics, boldface, bullets, vertical and\nhorizontal lines, etc.). Since ASCII usually appears in Courier font in most systems, you\nmay want to initially type your resume in Courier. Start your resume with a flush left\nmargin of zero, keeping your right margin at about 65 characters. You may want to test\nyour resume by sending it to a friend or copying yourself to see how it actually looks.\nBe sure to check to see if the employer has specific instructions on how to submit your\nresume.\nIf you are instructed to send an attachment, using a Word document is best.

But his original r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 was a five-page data dump that made the reader really\nwork to figure how what he\xe2\x80\x99d done.\nPart of his \xe2\x80\x9cproblem\xe2\x80\x9d was that he was good at just about every aspect of senior\nmanagement, so defining a brand and honing in on the most relevant achievements was\na challenge. I embraced his multiple talents as assets and positioned him a leader who\ndelivers bottom-line growth by improving every aspect of business from Sales to\nOperations to HR. I built a branding statement and brief introductory profile to set the\nexpectations of the reader accordingly.\n\nRather than trying to include all of his accomplishments, I honed in on representative\nprojects from each of his areas of strength, creating mini case studies that provide insight\ninto Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s management style and proof of his effectiveness. One of his\naccomplishments, saving $30M per year in delivery model operations, became a simple\ngraph that tells an immediate story to the reader.\nI wanted to take advantage of Bradley\xe2\x80\x99s stellar early career performance as an executive\nat a major bank without risking age discrimination. So I created an Early Career\nSummary without dates.\nBradley\xe2\x80\x99s new resume generated a lot of interest.

The resume is also a great way to capture and organize, neatly and concisely, your\nskills and experience which will be very useful when it comes time to interview. The resume is the primary tool of your job\nsearch and may take several drafts to prepare effectively.\nResumes must do their work quickly. Employers or Human Resources personnel may look through hundreds of resumes for a\nparticular position and may spend only a few seconds reviewing each. To get someone to look at it longer, your resume must\nconvey quickly that you are capable and competent enough to be worth an interview. Employers use this tool to screen potential\ncandidates before granting interviews, so the goal is to use the resume to entice the employer to want to meet you. The more\nthoroughly you prepare your resume now, the more likely someone is to read it later.\n\nCOMPONENTS OF A RESUME\nThere are four basic styles of resumes:\nREVERSE-CHRONOLOGICAL\nAlso called simply \xe2\x80\x9cChronological,\xe2\x80\x9d this is the most common resume format. It\xe2\x80\x99s also the simplest to create. Education\nand Experience are each listed by category, in reverse-chronological (most recent first) order. The chronological\nresume is usually best for undergraduates and entry-level candidates. This handout will focus primarily on the\nchronological resume format.\nFUNCTIONAL (experience sorted by relevance to career objective)\nA functional resume differs from a chronological resume by concentrating on skills that you have used that relate to\nyour stated objective rather than on the jobs you have had.\nA functional resume is particularly effective if your work experience has not been closely related to your job objective, if\nyou are changing careers, or if you are seeking a promotion. In this format you elaborate on the skills necessary to\nperform the desired job and how you have demonstrated those same skills in different types of jobs.\nBecause the Functional Resume is not recommended for most entry-level candidates, it will not be described in detail in\nthis handout.\nCOMBINATION\nThe combination chronological/functional resume uses elements of both styles. The qualifications (areas of\neffectiveness) of the functional resume remain within specific job/experience descriptions. The jobs/experiences are\nthen grouped and categorized to show the strengths in two to four categories. This resume format is effective if at least\nsome of your experience is related to the job objective, and also when the job objective has more than one component\nand you have experience in these different components (e.g., technical and management; sales and organizational).\nBecause the Combination Resume is not recommended for most entry-level candidates, it will not be described in detail\nin this handout.\nCURRICULUM VITAE\nAlso called a \xe2\x80\x9cCV,\xe2\x80\x9d this is a highly specialized resume format used by those individuals seeking a teaching and/or\nresearch position in a postsecondary institution or high-level research industry. Information in all categories should be in\nreverse chronological order (the most recent data first).\n\n3\n\n\x0cCreating your Chronological Resume:\nI.\n\nHeader\nYour contact information\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Your name should be the biggest item on the page and be on its own line\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use an address where you can receive correspondence\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Supply the phone number whose line offers you the most privacy for you to speak professionally on (ensure you\nhave a PROFESSIONAL greeting on your answering machine)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Include your e-mail address\n\xe2\x80\xa2 DO NOT list your age, gender, religion, political affiliation, marital status, health status or social security number\n\nII.\n\nObjective\nA clear and concise statement that can communicate the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The position or field you desire and your long term goals\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The position or field you are pursuing and the skills you wish to use\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The position or field you desire and the responsibilities you are seeking\n\xe2\x80\xa2 REMEMBER \xe2\x80\x93 a poor objective can hurt a resume. Be sure NOT to use vague, general statements (e.g, \xe2\x80\x9cElectrical\nengineering graduate looking to apply leadership and technical skills to a challenging position with potential for\ngrowth.\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nIII.\n\nEducation\nWhere you can indicate your educational and academic background\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Name of Institution, City, State\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Type of degree: Bachelor of Science, Master of Science, Ph.D.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Date of graduation or anticipated graduation date\nAdditional Sub-headings under Education could be:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Academic Projects: especially Senior Design Project which can be a separate sub-heading\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Related Coursework: 4-6 courses that relate to the employer and/or position, no more than 8\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Honors: Deans List, with semesters, Honor Societies, Scholarships, Awards, Academic Honors, etc.\nOptional information could be:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GPA if 3.0 or above (general rule of thumb, if GPA is not above a 3.0, do not include it)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Fundamentals of Engineering Exam can be phrased: \xe2\x80\x9cCertified Engineer-in-Training, Date\xe2\x80\x9d once you\xe2\x80\x99ve passed\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Hours worked to finance ___% of your education\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Any relevant seminars or workshops you\xe2\x80\x99ve attended\n\nIV.\n\nExperience\nInformation that should be included:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Name of company\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Location of company, city, state\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dates of employment\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Job Titles and if applicable, department\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide a brief job description (bulleted list or short paragraph), using appropriate action verbs that emphasize your\nstrengths. Make sure you use the proper verb tense.\no Focus on your significant achievements and contributions\no Focus on how you saved the employer time and money\no QUANTIFY your accomplishments whenever possible\nFor example: \xe2\x80\x9cProject scheduled for 49 days completed in 27\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSoftware enhancements cut required\npurchase processing time by 38 percent\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf applicable, you can divide your work experience into two categories: \xe2\x80\x9cExperience\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9cRelated Experience\xe2\x80\x9d) and\n\xe2\x80\x9cAdditional Experience\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9cOther Experience\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n4\n\n\x0cV.\n\nSkills\nThere are three different skill sets that can be listed as sub-headings under \xe2\x80\x9cSkills\xe2\x80\x9d or be their own main heading.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Computer Skills: List ALL computer skills in some type of order\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Language Skills: If need be, you can break these out into \xe2\x80\x9cFluent in\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cConversational in\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Lab Skills\n\nVI.\n\nActivities/Affiliations\nList any memberships or affiliations you have, indicating any offices held and achievements related to these activities.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Membership in an engineering society, honor societies, student organizations, etc.\n\nVII.\n\nInterests (not essential)\nThis section is used to show that you are a well-rounded individual. List any hobbies or interests that you feel might\nadd \xe2\x80\x9cspice\xe2\x80\x9d to your profile. Make sure that the information you provide is appropriate and useful.\n\nVIII.\n\nOther Possible Section Headings\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Citizenship\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Military Experience\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPublications and/or Patents held or pending\nVolunteer/Community Activities\n\nTHE GLANCE TEST\nTo make sure your resume looks flawless and noticeable, you want to make sure that your resume will pass the glance test.\nYou should ask yourself these questions when preparing for the glance test:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIs your format consistent throughout the resume?\no If you use periods, use periods throughout.\no Use the same bullets throughout.\no If indenting, indent the same amount each time.\no Make sure top and bottom margins are equal and right and left margins are equal.\no Use standard typefaces such as Arial, Helvetica, Universe, Times, Palatino, Century, and Courier.\no Use a font size of 10 to 14 points. (Avoid Times New Roman 10 point).\no Avoid fancy treatments such as italics, underline, shadows, and reverse (white letters on black background).\no Avoid vertical and horizontal lines, graphics, and boxes.\no Avoid two-column format or resumes that look like newspapers or newsletters.\no List each phone number and e-mail on its own line.\nDo you have too much or not enough white space?\no You want to make sure that you format the resume so that the white space is kept to a minimum, while not\noverwhelming the reader with too much text.\nDoes your resume look symmetrical?\nHave you SPELL-CHECKED? There is NO excuse for a misspelled word and recruiters may view it as laziness\nAre you utilizing action verbs? (A list of actions verbs can be found on page 7)\nHave you proofread?\n\nOnce you\xe2\x80\x99ve answered these questions to your satisfaction and corrected any problems found, proceed with the glance test.\nHold your resume in front of you for ten seconds\xe2\x80\xa6does it look good, are you satisfied with your work?\n\n5\n\n\x0cOTHER MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWhen writing numbers, numbers one \xe2\x80\x93 ten should be spelled out, numbers 11, 12, 13, 14\xe2\x80\xa6can be written using\nthe number symbol.\nWhen describing your past experience, use verbs written in the past tense (Designed). When describing your\npresent experience, use present-tense verbs (Design).\n\nWHAT NOT TO PUT ON A RESUME\nThere are certain pieces of information that you should never include on your resume. These include:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Your social security number. Who knows who\xe2\x80\x99s hands your resume could fall into? Identity theft is a very real problem,\nand they don\xe2\x80\x99t need your SSN until after you\xe2\x80\x99ve been hired, anyway.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Personal information that could be used to discriminate against you. An employer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to know your age, race,\nreligion, gender, marital status, whether or not you have kids, your nation of origin, your weight, your height, your sexual\norientation, or your politics. None of that has anything to do with your ability to carry out the requirements of the\njob. It\xe2\x80\x99s illegal for employers to even ask you for that information while you\xe2\x80\x99re applying, so you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t volunteer the\ninformation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 References. The only person who\xe2\x80\x99s name should be on your resume is yourself. It\xe2\x80\x99s good to have references that you\ncan give to an employer when they ask, but they should always be on a separate document, which you give to the\nemployer only after they\xe2\x80\x99ve asked. It\xe2\x80\x99s common to conclude a resume with \xe2\x80\x9cReferences Available Upon Request,\xe2\x80\x9d and\nthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing wrong with including that if you have room, but it\xe2\x80\x99s generally assumed by most employers that you can\nprovide references when asked.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Anything negative. Did you get fired from a previous job? Did you get laid off because your boss ran the company into\nthe ground? Do you hate eating your vegetables? Whatever it is, keep it to yourself. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want to look like a\ncomplainer, and you certainly don\xe2\x80\x99t want to look like a backstabber. Only provide positive information about yourself,\nand never badmouth a previous employer, even if working for them was the worst experience of your entire life.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 First person pronouns. Using words like \xe2\x80\x9cI,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cme,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmy,\xe2\x80\x9d etc, just doesn\xe2\x80\x99t look very professional. Avoid them, which\nshould be easier if you\xe2\x80\x99re making an effort to start sentences with verbs. The only place it\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate to use a first\nperson pronoun is in your Objective statement or possibly referring to \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d on a group project, but try to avoid it.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Your picture. You\xe2\x80\x99re applying for a professional position, not auditioning for a TV show. They don\xe2\x80\x99t need a headshot.\n\nRECRUITERS\xe2\x80\x99 TOP 10 RESUME PET PEEVES\nRecently, ResumeDoctor.com1 asked more than 2,500 recruiters from a variety of industries what their pet peeves were when\nit comes to resumes:\n1.) Spelling Errors, Typos and Poor Grammar \xe2\x80\x93 make sure you spell-check AND proofread\n2.) Too Duty-Oriented \xe2\x80\x93 don\xe2\x80\x99t just write the company\xe2\x80\x99s summary of your position, explain your accomplishments\n3.) Inaccurate Dates or None at All \xe2\x80\x93 this missing or inaccurate information could send up red flags\n4.) Inaccurate or Missing Contact Information \xe2\x80\x93 if a recruiter can\xe2\x80\x99t reach you they will move on to someone else\n5.) Poor Formatting\n6.) Functional Resumes\n7.) Long Resumes \xe2\x80\x93 too much information will simply waste a recruiter\xe2\x80\x99s time\n8.) Long Paragraphs \xe2\x80\x93 stay focused and concise\n9.) Unqualified Candidates\n10.) Personal Information Unrelated to the Job\n\n6\n\n\x0cACTION VERBS\nGood use of action verbs can mean the difference when it comes to getting your foot in the door and being invited for an interview.\nRemember, a hiring manager probably sees dozens of resumes for each position they\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fill, each with a similar list of skills and\nexperience. The key is to make sure yours gets noticed. When describing experience, try to start each sentence with an action verb.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t use the same verb repeatedly, and don\xe2\x80\x99t limit yourself to this list.\nA-B: accelerated,

Considering which transferable skills you want to convey to employers is a\ngreat place to start when composing your resume. This list is a sampling of the types of\nskills you might highlight on your resume, in addition to those skills that are more\nspecific to your major, intended industry, or job function.\nA sampling of action verbs is also included on this page. Be sure to use strong action\nverbs to begin each of your bulleted statements, previewing the skill to be exemplified\nthrough the accomplishment statement.\n\nIV.\n\nChronological Resume Samples...\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6...Pages 6-11\nIn this most commonly accepted resume format, job titles and employers are\nemphasized, starting with your most recent experiences to illustrate a progressive work\nhistory. Your skills and accomplishments are described through bulleted statements\nunder each position. This resume type is recommended for people who have recently\ngraduated with a bachelor\xe2\x80\x99s degree, those who are staying within the same career field,\nand candidates with few time gaps in their job history. This type is most often preferred\nby employers because it is easy to scan, highlights job titles, employers, and dates, and\nclearly ties candidates\xe2\x80\x99 skills and accomplishments to their work histories.\n\nV.\n\nFunctional & Combination Resume Samples...\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6..Pages 12-13\nThis format is an option for candidates who have changed employers frequently,\nhave gaps in their employment history, or are hoping to transition to a new industry\nor unrelated job function. Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight\ntransferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and\nemployers.\n\nVI.\n\nAdditional Career Center Resume Resources\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6...Page 14\n\n2\n\n\x0cI. Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics\nThe purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,\nand skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,\nthink of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect\ncandidate for the opportunity at hand.\nResume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best\npractices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content\nand a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with\nregard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify\nthe skills you possess and employers are seeking.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should\nkeep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing\nelements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the reader\xe2\x80\x99s eye to rest.\nUsing .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A\n10-12 point font size is recommended.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold\na job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,\ndates, etc. line up neatly on the page.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully\nread through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least\n2-3 people proofread it as well.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when\nyou have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,\nquantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry\nor job function-specific) and transferable skills.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the\nskill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily\nscan your resume for what he or she is seeking.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is\nassumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \xe2\x80\x9cMy duties included...\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMy responsibilities\nwere\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xef\x81\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.\nAlso, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your\nmost important information stands out.\n\n3\n\n\x0cII. Key Elements of a Successful Resume\nYour First and Last Name\n\xe2\x99\xa6 Phone number \xe2\x99\xa6 Email address \xe2\x99\xa6 Street address \xe2\x99\xa6 City, state & zip code \xe2\x99\xa6\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOBJECTIVE\nCreate a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area\nyou are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be\nomitted or substituted with a \xe2\x80\x95Career Highlights\xe2\x80\x96 or \xe2\x80\x95Summary of Qualifications\xe2\x80\x96 section.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEDUCATION\nInstitution City, State\n(Expected) Graduation Month Year\nWrite out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations\nGPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher)\nOther possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings]\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nThe position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of\nthe Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements.\nYou can bold or italicize your title or your organization\xe2\x80\x94whichever is more relevant, but be consistent.\nIn this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the\nskills employers are seeking.\nStart with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when\npossible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or\nmore skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them.\nConsider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work?\nWhat were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does\nthis experience relate to your internship/employment goal?\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nBulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation.\nBe specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible.\nMake sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or\nmaking it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER,\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings]\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nUsing multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant\nexperience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order.\nPositions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points.\nIn an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are\napplying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history.\nEmphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere.\nOrganization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter) \xe2\x80\x93 City, State Month Year - Month Year\nThis section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement,\nprofessional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace \xe2\x80\x95job title\xe2\x80\x96 with the role you played.\nIncluding bullet points is optional, depending on what you wish to convey to a potential employer.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nADDITIONAL SKILLS [List skills that are testable and concrete. Soft skills such as communication, organizational, and\ninterpersonal skills should not be listed here, but rather incorporated into your bulleted accomplishment statements above.]\nTechnology: Try to include programs that would not be assumed based on education and include your proficiency level. For\nexample: Advanced User of Microsoft Office Suite, including Outlook, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as Adobe Photoshop.\nLanguages: For example: Proficient in oral and written German; Beginner knowledge of Spanish.\n\n4\n\n\x0cIII.

It should also help the\nemployer understand how these qualifications/experiences relate to their hiring needs.\nResume writing is both a skill and an art form. Writing a resume requires careful consideration, strategy, and\nconstruction each time you apply for a new position. This means every time you submit an application, you will need to\nwrite an altered resume tailored to each specific position.\nDO NOT PANIC! While it may seem like a lot of work in the beginning, the more you practice, the easier writing effective\ntailored resumes will become. This guide will help you learn the major elements of effective resume writing and walk you\nthrough the process of constructing a strong professional document.\nThe General Rules of Resume Writing\n1. Resumes should not be a step by step recap of everything you have ever done. Rather, it is a document that\nhighlights the most relevant skills and experiences as they relate to the position for which you are applying.\n2. Resumes should be written in the third person. Never use references to yourself in the first person, i.e. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cMe,\xe2\x80\x9d\nor \xe2\x80\x9cMy.\xe2\x80\x9d\n3. Resumes for undergraduates should be confined to one page.* Resumes for professionals with a wealth of\nexperience or with education levels of master\xe2\x80\x99s degrees or higher should be no longer than two pages.*\n*The exception to this rule is Federal resume writing\n4. In the United States, resumes should not contain personal information regarding race, ethnicity, sex, gender,\nreligious affiliation (unless affiliation is professional in nature), or age.

Traditional Resume Section Headings\nResumes can have a variety of sections and section headers. The sections you choose to include in your resume are\nyour choice, however there are some sections that MUST be included on every resume. Below, you will find a list of\nrequired sections as well as additional sections you may want to consider depending on your experience and industry.\nContact Information (Required)\nContact information should be the section at the very top of the resume that includes your name, telephone number,\nemail address, and postal address. It does not need a heading.\n\nMARTIN MARYMOUNT\nmmarymount@marymount.edu\n(703) 555-5555\n123 All Saints Way\nArlington, VA, 22207\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cOBJECTIVE (Optional)\nThe objective section is an element of the resume that is not generally recommended for college students but may be\nrequired by an employer. The objective should be a one to two sentence description of the kind of position you are\nlooking to obtain. If you choose to include this section, be sure to specify the kind of industry and work you would like to\ndo. Try not to be so general that the objective is unclear, but at the same time, not so specific that an employer can use\nthe objective to screen you out of the hiring process.\nExample:\n\xef\x82\xb7 \xe2\x80\x9cSeeking an accounts specialist position at JP Morgan Chase\xe2\x80\x99s Arlington office.\xe2\x80\x9d\no Too specific! This objective tells the employer that you only want a position as an accounts specialist\nand only in one branch office. If there is a similar position in a different office, you may not be\nconsidered.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeking an internship position.\xe2\x80\x9d\no Too general! This objective does not add any value to your resume as it does not clarify industry or\nexperiences you are looking to gain.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cSeeking an entry level accounting position in top tier financial services firm with opportunities to both work\nwith a diverse client base and gain experience in corporate accounts. \xe2\x80\x9c\no Good! A nice balance of the general industry interests and experiences the person is seeking without\nlimiting what they might be considered for.\n\nQUALIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS/ PROFESSIONAL PROFILE (Optional)\nThis section can be either a bulleted list or a paragraph summarizing your best qualities and most relevant experiences.\nThis section gives the employer a general sense of how you are qualified for this position as well as how well your\nprevious experiences have prepared you for the kind of work you may be performing in your new position.\nQUALIFICATION HIGHLIGHTS\n\xef\x82\xb7 Motivated Fashion major with experience working in both the design and\nmerchandising areas of the Fashion industry.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Strong teamwork and leadership skills with ability to communicate effectively in\nverbal and written formats.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Specialized skills in constructing wedding gowns and formal women\xe2\x80\x99s wear\n\nOR\nPROFESSIONAL PROFILE\nAspiring public relations professional with radio and television broadcast media\nexperience. Strong organizational, communication, and multi-tasking abilities with\nproven successes managing multiple projects and events. Hard-working and motivated\nindividual with results-oriented perspective and commitment to excellence in customer\nsatisfaction.\n\nEDUCATION (Required)\nThis section should include any educational experiences you have completed or are currently completing AFTER HIGH\nSCHOOL. High school should not be included on a resume once a student has entered college. Items to include in the\neducation section include the kind of degree you are obtaining (e.g. Bachelor of Arts), major and/or minor, the date you\nexpect to graduate, name of your school, location of school (city and state only unless outside the USA), and GPA if it is 3.0\nor higher (if not, do not include). Relevant coursework and study abroad experiences can also be included here.\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cEDUCATION\nBachelor of Science in Nursing, Degree Expected: May 2015\nMarymount University, Arlington, VA; GPA: 3.7\nOR\nEDUCATION\nB.A. in Business Administration, concentration in Finance, Minor in Math\nMarymount University, Arlington, VA; GPA: 3.2\nStudy Abroad: \xe2\x80\x9cEuropean Finance\xe2\x80\x9d in London, England\nRelevant Coursework: Accounting, Finance I, Advanced Economics\n\nExpected: 05/14\nSummer 2013\n\nEXPERIENCE (Required)\nThe experience section (or sections) of the resume is the area where a person should list previous experiences in which\nthey have formally utilized or demonstrated work-related skills and abilities. These experiences can be formal job\nexperiences, volunteer experiences, leadership experiences, or internship experiences. To include an experience, one\nshould be able to associate a title with it (e.g. \xe2\x80\x9cVolunteer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPresident,\xe2\x80\x9d or formal job title). Experiences should be listed\nin reverse chronological order (most recent to least recent) and should be formatted uniformly. It is okay to have more\nthan one experience section (e.g. a \xe2\x80\x9cRELEVANT EXPERIENCE\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE\xe2\x80\x9d section or \xe2\x80\x9cWORK\nEXPERIENCE\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cVOLUNTEER EXPERIENCE\xe2\x80\x9d section), but be sure to list the most relevant experiences first.\nThe experience description should include the title of your position, the name and location of your\ncompany/organization, start and end dates (including month and year) and no less than two bullet points or sentences\ndescribing a skill, knowledge set, ability, qualification, or recognition/award received. Bullet points should emphasize\ntransferable skills and should be no longer than 2 sentences (ideally only one sentence). If you have more than one\nexperience section, additional experience sections may not require bullet points.\nEXPERIENCE\nCashier, The Juice Factory\n05/2011 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nArlington, VA\n\xef\x82\xb7 Demonstrated strong communication skills while interacting with and serving customers\n\xef\x82\xb7 Exercised efficient time management when completing multiple tasks in fast-paced service\nenvironment\nOR \xef\x82\xb7 Recognized as \xe2\x80\x9cEmployee of the Month\xe2\x80\x9d for July 2011, March 2012, and January 2013\nRELATED EXPERIENCE\nGraphic Design Intern, CoolArts Inc.\nJanuary 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\nVienna, VA\n\xef\x82\xb7 Developed creative print marketing ads utilizing specialized design software\n\xef\x82\xb7 Designed web portfolio for 3 resident artists resulting in increase in client business\n\xef\x82\xb7 Assisted management in redesigning company logo\nADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE\nStudent Assistant, Lee Center at Marymount University\nArlington, VA\nWaitress, Rock Bottom Brewery\nArlington, VA\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\nSeptember 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 Present\n\nMay 2011 \xe2\x80\x93 September 2011\n\n\x0cConstructing the bullet points or sentence descriptions of your experiences may seem a bit tricky at first. To help\nyou get used to this style of writing, keep in mind that every bullet point should have three major components:\nAn action verb to start the bullet, the skill you are trying to emphasize, and the tasks that evidence your ability to\nperform that skill.\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nDemonstrated strong communication skills while interacting with and serving customers\nAction Verb\nSkill\nTasks\n\nConstruct your bullet points by following these steps:\nStep 1: Identify the skill/ability/qualification, etc. you would like to describe and write it down. To decide which skills\nto describe, you can use a variety of different methods.\na) Go to the job posting/description of the position for which you are applying. Underline or highlight the skills\nthe employer is looking for in an ideal candidate for this position. Identify the skills that you feel you most\nstrongly possess and write bullet points around those skills. If your job has no job posting, use an online\nsearch engine like www.simplyhired.com or www.indeed.com to look for similar positions and use the key\nskills emphasized in these postings. If you would like a more comprehensive list of job search engines by\nindustry, visit our website at www.marymount.edu/careerservices.\nb) Using the job title for which you are applying, do some research using www.onetonline.org or\nwww.bls.gov/ooh. These websites outline and describe thousands of job titles in the USA and specifically list\nthe kinds of skills and abilities required to effectively perform these jobs.\nc) Perform an informational interview (See Networking and Personal Branding E-Guide for more information\non this kind of interview) with an industry professional either in a job similar to the job for which you are\napplying or in a position that supervises the kind of job for which you are applying and inquire as to what\nkinds of skills and abilities are most important for that job.\nd) Look at the transferable skills list towards the end of this e-guide.\nStep 2: Think about the tasks and duties you performed in your experience that effectively evidence your ability to\nperform this skill. Write these down in a list on a separate sheet of paper.\nExample:\nPrevious position title: Student Front Desk Assistant\nSkill: Communication\nTasks:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Talked with customers at the front desk\n\xef\x82\xb7 Answered phones\n\xef\x82\xb7 Wrote emails to clients\nStep 3: Choose an action verb that helps the employer understand how or in what way you used or demonstrated this\nskill (See list of action verbs at the back of this document for help). Note that action verbs should be in\nPRESENT TENSE if you are currently working in the listed position and PAST TENSE if you are no longer working\nin the listed position.\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cExample:\nSkill: Communication\nSample Action Verbs:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nExercised communication skills\nUtilized communication skills\nDemonstrated communication skills\n\nStep 4: Write your bullet point!\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nExercised communication skills when talking with customers, answering phones and writing\nemails to clients.\n\nGreat! Now you have written an effective bullet point. It is strong as it is, however you can make it even stronger by\nadding in some additional descriptors like adjectives and quantifiers (a.k.a. numbers) to clarify your skills, communicate\ncompetence, or emphasize a positive result of your actions. Use adjectives cautiously! Stay away from claims of\nexcellence like \xe2\x80\x9cAmazing,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cFantastic,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cSuperb,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cExcellent,\xe2\x80\x9d etc. as these adjectives may be perceived as an indication of\narrogance rather than confidence. For a list of strong adjectives, see our adjective list at the back of this document.\nAdjective\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nQuantifiers\n\nExercised strong communication skills when talking with 20+ customers per day,\nanswering phones, and writing emails to clients.\n\nRESEARCH and/or PROJECTS (Optional)\nThis is a section commonly used by students to help show employers relevant academic work that has allowed them to\ndevelop skills the employer values. You can include any research papers, individual or group projects, and presentations\non relevant topics in this section. The description should include the title of the project or paper, the semester(s) date in\nwhich it was completed, the name of the school/organization at which it was conducted/completed, the location of the\nschool/organization, and a 2-3 sentence description of the project, skills used, and results. If you are going to list a group\nproject, make sure to clearly state that it was a group project. You must not take credit for the work of others.\n\nPROJECTS/RESEARCH\nSenior Seminar Business Project (Group Project)\nFall 2012\nMarymount University, Arlington, VA\n\xef\x82\xb7 Exercised effective team work skills while collaborating with group of 6 students to develop\nbusiness plan for hypothetical manufacturing company.

Computer applications you are\nfamiliar with and foreign language proficiencies should be listed here (name of language and proficiency level: basic,\nintermediate, advanced, and fluent). Note that for IT majors, this section will be much more extensive and include several\nsubheadings for additional technical proficiencies (e.g. applications, browsers, languages, etc.) For certain majors,\nincluding social media proficiencies (Facebook/Twitter/Pinterest) may also be a good idea. If you have no foreign language\nskills, simply do not list.\nSKILLS\nTechnical:\nLanguage:\n\nMicrosoft Office Suite, Photo Shop, Types 45 WPM\nFluent in French, Basic Spanish\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cACTIVITIES/HONORS/AFFILIATIONS (Optional, but strongly recommended)\nThis section is where you should place any extracurricular activities (e.g. club membership, college sports, community\nservice, volunteer work that is not listed as experience), professional organization memberships, and awards/recognition\nyou have received. This list should contain information that is relevant to the job for which you are applying or gives the\nemployer a better understanding of your character. You can have a separate section for each of these headers or you can\ncombine them as shown below. If you only want to describe one item header (e.g. only ACTIVITIES) that is fine as well.\nThe purpose of this section is to help the employer understand what sets you apart from other individuals with similar\neducation, experiences, and skills.\nACTIVITIES/HONORS/AFFILIATIONS\nPresident, STEM Club, Marymount University\nMember, National Association of Science and Technology Students\nPresidential Scholarship, U.S. Department of Education\nVolunteer, Helping Hands Homeless Shelter\n\n09/2012- Present\n09/2011 - Present\n05/2011\n05/2011 \xe2\x80\x93 09/2011\n\n2. Industry-Specific Section Headings\nIt is important to note that every industry has its own standards for resume writing. These general instructions are a\nfantastic guideline to get you started, but, to make the appropriate finishing touches, it would be best to check in with\nindustry professionals, professors, and your Career Services office to be sure you are covering all of the necessary\ninformation for your industry. There are some industry-specific resume examples in this document, but if you would like\nto view more resume samples, log on to Jobs4Saints and visit their Resume Gallery.\n\nCURRICULUM VITAE (CVs)\nA Curriculum Vitae in the United States is a special kind of resume-like document that is primarily used by college\nprofessors and individuals pursuing high-level education/research or executive careers. It is very similar to the traditional\nresume only it is much longer (no page limit) and includes additional sections for Research, Publications,\nTeaching/Training Experience, etc. It may also go into more detail than a traditional resume about the types of\naccomplishments a person has made. CVs in the US are highly tailored to each position and are written in a similar format\nto the resume, the difference being in length and additional section headings. For additional assistance in constructing a\nCV, please contact the Center for Career Services. It is important to note that many other countries (especially European\ncountries like the United Kingdom, France, etc.) refer to what Americans call a \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional resume\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cCV.\xe2\x80\x9d This\nmeans that if you are applying to a company in London, England, and they ask for a CV, they are really asking for your\ntraditional 1-2 page US resume with some additional information. For information about writing resumes for careers\nabroad, contact the Center for Career Services and/or the Center for Global Education.\n\nFEDERAL RESUMES\nFederal resumes are written similarly to public and private sector resumes, but differ in a few specific ways. The\nsection headings for a Federal resume are generally the same and experiences are described either in paragraphs or bullet\npoints. Here are the ways a Federal resume differs from other resumes:\n\xef\x82\xb7 Federal resumes have no page limit and are generally 3-5 pages long depending on experience\n\xef\x82\xb7 The OBJECTIVE section of a Federal resume contains the title and GS code for the position\n\xef\x82\xb7 Federal resumes contain significantly more personal information including your Social Security Number,\nCitizenship Status, Veteran\xe2\x80\x99s Status, and Security Clearances.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Experiences are described much more in depth and include information about your salary, hours worked,\naddress of company you worked at, supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s name and contact (and if it is all right to contact them)\n\xef\x82\xb7 There is no timeline limit for Federal resumes, you should include all work experiences regardless of\nrelevance.\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cSample Federal Resume\n\nPage 1\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cFederal Resume Sample\nPages 2 and 3\n\nFor more information on\nFederal resume writing,\ncontact:\nCenter for Career Services\n(703) 284-5960\ncareer.services@marymount.edu\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cResume Writing Tools and Samples\nTransferable Skills List\nManagement\nDecision-Making\nTechnical\nMulti-tasking\nEmotional Regulation\nInterpersonal Skills\nMotivating\nMediation\nCultural Sensitivity\nSupporting\n\nLeadership\nAnalysis\nFinancial\nOrganization\nConflict-Resolution\nPublic Speaking\nPersuasion\nCommunication\nLanguage\nMonitoring\n\nCritical Thinking\nEvaluation\nFacilitation\nAdministration\nProfessionalism\nResearch\nSelling\nProblem-Solving\nAssisting\nSupervising\n\nJudgment\nTeam Work\nTeaching\nManual Labor\nDevelopment\nPlanning\nPresenting\nWriting\nAssessment\nEmpathy\n\nAction Verb List\nAccomplished\nAddressed\nAided\nAscertained\nCentralized\nControlled\nDetected\nDirected\nEmployed\nEstimated\nExhibited\nFinalized\nFormed\nImplemented\nInterpreted\nLearned\nOrganized\nPrevented\nQuantified\nReasoned\nRecognized\nSalvaged\nStarted\nSupported\nTested\nVisualized\n\nAchieved\nAdministered\nAnalyzed\nAssessed\nCompared\nCoordinated\nDetermined\nDiscerned\nEnforced\nEvaluated\nExperimented\nFulfilled\nFound\nInnovated\nInvestigated\nMeasured\nPerceived\nProjected\nQuestioned\nRecruited\nRedesigned\nSaved\nStrategized\nSurveyed\nTranslated\nWeighed\n\nActed\nAdvanced\nAppraised\nAttained\nCompleted\nCultivated\nDeveloped\nDiscovered\nEnlisted\nExamined\nExplored\nForecast\nGenerated\nInitiated\nInspected\nMerged\nPredicted\nProved\nReached\nResearched\nReorganized\nSelected\nStudied\nSynthesized\nUndertook\n\nAdapted\nAdvised\nArranged\nAverted\nConducted\nDemonstrated\nDiagnosed\nDocumented\nEstablished\nExecuted\nFacilitated\nFostered\nIdentified\nInstituted\nLaunched\nObserved\nPrepared\nQualified\nReasoned\nReviewed\nResolved\nSolved\nSubstantiated\nSystemized\nVerified\n\nAdjective List\nSuccessful(ly)\nCompetent(ly)\nEfficient(ly)\nEffective(ly)\nStrong(ly)\nEnthusiastic(ly)\nSteady (ily)\nCareful(ly)\nSensitive(ly)\nImportant\nGracious(ly)\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\nModern\nRealistic(ally)\nVast(ly)\nAccurate(ly)\nAssertive(ly)\nHigh-level\nOrderly\nPractical(ly)\nDiscreet(ly)\nOptimal\nJudicious(ly)\n\nPowerful(ly)\nThoughtful(ly)\nAbsolute(ly)\nAggressive(ly)\nAuthentic(ally)\nImpartial\nProductive(ly)\nSavvy\nResponsible(ly)\nLasting\nCritical(ly)\n\n\x0cStandard Undergraduate Student Resume\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cInformation Technology Resume Sample\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cNursing Resume Template\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cStandard Graduate Resume Page 1\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cStandard Graduate Resume Page 2\n\nFor more resume samples by major/industry, login to Jobs4Saints and check out the Resume Gallery.\n\nMarymount Center for Career Services \xc2\xa92013\nCompiled by Amanda Sargent and Carin Usrey\n\n\x0cADDITIONAL RESUME WRITING RESOURCES AT THE CENTER FOR CAREER SERVICES\nIn addition to the information and examples this e-guide offers, the Center for Career Services also provides the following\nservices and materials to support the development of effective, tailored, resumes.

Use this information when creating your resume to describe your experiences and the\nskills gained from these experiences. For example, if you have researched a topic for class and then wrote, edited, and presented a\nfinal research paper in front of your peers, you have used skills (gathering information, writing, problem-solving, presenting) which\nare not limited to that specific academic discipline, but are transferable to many occupations.\n\nResearch and\nplanning\n\nHuman relations\n\nOrganizing,\nmanagement and\nleadership\n\nWork survival\n\nThe skillful expression\nand interpretation of\nknowledge and ideas.\n\nThe search for specific\nknowledge and the ability\nto conceptualize future\nneeds and solutions.\n\nThe use of interpersonal\nskills for resolving\nconflict, relating to and\nhelping people.\n\nAbility to supervise and\nguide individuals and\ngroups in the\ncompletion of goals.\n\nThe daily skills that\nassist in promoting\neffective production and\nwork satisfaction.\n\nSpeaking effectively\n\nPredicting\n\nDeveloping\nrelationships\n\nInitiating new ideas\n\nImplementing decisions\n\nWriting effectively\n\nCreating theories and\nideas\n\nBeing sensitive\n\nHandling details\n\nCooperating\n\nIdentifying problems\n\nListening\n\nCoordinating tasks\n\nEnforcing policies\n\nImagining alternatives\n\nConveying feelings\n\nManaging groups\n\nBeing punctual\n\nIdentifying resources\n\nProviding support\n\nDelegating\nresponsibility\n\nManaging time\n\nGathering information\n\nMotivating\n\nTeaching\n\nSolving problems\n\nSharing credit\n\nPerceiving non-verbal\nmessages\n\nCoaching\n\nSetting goals\n\nCounseling\n\nAdvising\n\nPresenting information\n\nExtracting information\n\nCooperating\n\nPromoting change\n\nAccepting\nresponsibility\n\nDescribing feelings\n\nDefining needs\n\nDelegating with respect\n\nInterviewing\n\nDeveloping evaluations\n\nRepresenting others\n\nSelling ideas or\nproducts\n\nSetting and meeting\ndeadlines\n\nEditing\n\nCreating spreadsheets\nand databases\n\nPerceiving feelings,\nsituations\n\nDecision making with\nothers\n\nOrganizing\n\nCommunication\n\nListening attentively\nExpressing ideas\nFacilitating discussions\nNegotiating\nPersuading\n\nCalculating results\n\nAsserting\n\nAttending to detail\nMeeting goals\nEnlisting help\n\nMaking decisions\nManaging conflict\n\nPage 3\n\n\x0cACTION VERBS:\nAction verbs are an effective way to begin a skills statement.

Generally a graduate resume\nshould be 2-3 full pages and a CV should be 3-5 pages long. However, based on your experiences, career field, and the position\ndescription, it could be longer or shorter. Whatever the case, only print your document on one side of the paper and include\nyour name and the page number at the top of each page.\nAvoid using a resume or CV template. This decreases your ability to personalize and make changes as your document evolves.\nYour resume or CV should be well organized, without spelling errors, and easy to read. An employer spends a short amount of\ntime reading your document\xe2\x80\x94it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications.\nTo organize your document, you may choose to use bold, italics, all caps, indenting, and bullets. You will want to use these\nsparingly to emphasize the most important information. Avoid pictures, graphics, non-black ink, shading, and symbols instead\nof traditional, round, solid bullet points.\nIt is a good idea to start with a 1-inch margin on each side. You can expand the margins if need be. Font size should be\nbetween 10-12 point, and you will want to choose easy to read font styles, such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Garamond.\nKeep font size and style consistent throughout your CV (except for your name, which should be a larger size).\nPresent your resume or CV on quality bond paper (20 pound)\xe2\x80\x94choose white or off-white to ensure your document is easy to\nread.\nIf you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your document directly, keep the format simple when\nfilling in required information.\nIf you are requested to submit your documents via email, save your resume or CV and cover letter (if applicable) as attachments. Include a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose.\n\nTIPS FOR RESUME AND CV WRITING:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nMake sure that your resume or CV is a unique and personal document. It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes or CVs\nbut also important to make it your own.\nThere are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume or CV, but there are also options and room for choice. If\nyou give your document to several people, they may all give you different feedback. Beyond some of our strongly suggested\nguidelines, resumes and CVs are subjective.\nBe 100% honest and factual. Avoid abbreviations.\nOrganize your document so the most important information is at the top.\nDo not include a work history. Rather, include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of\nskill.\nPersonal information, such as marital status, age, ethnicity, height, and weight should not be included.\nAvoid personal pronouns (I, my, we) and complete sentences to describe your experiences. Start your statements with action\nverbs.\nAlways proofread your resume or CV. Do not solely rely on spell check. Some employers may eliminate candidates based on\nerrors.\nIt is suggested that you tailor your resume or CV to the job description. You may have more than one version of your\ndocument depending on the positions to which you are applying . You may change the order of sections to list more relevant\nareas of your experience closer to the top.\nRemember that your resume or CV is YOUR marketing tool. Many times it is an employer\xe2\x80\x99s first impression of you. It is also a\nwork in progress that you will continually revise.\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nVisit www.ccse.umn.edu to view our Resume Writing or Curriculum Vitae Workshops.\nVisit the CSE Career Center Resource Center to view our Resume Examples Binder and related books.\nHave your resume or CV reviewed by a CSE Career Counselor.

My work while achieving my M.Ed. and Ed.S., involved the\ndevelopment and delivery of habilitation and educational services to person with developmental\ndisabilities. During that period I was a teacher, a director of a community educational program,\nand performed research and demonstration activities at Kent State University. While in\nKentucky, I worked towards developing integrated and ""state of the art"" educational and\nrehabilitation services for persons with disabilities. Further, I spent two years attempting to assist\npersons with disabilities accessing appropriate employment outcomes. Upon returning to Ohio, I\nworked with adults that had a college education, to access meaningful and appropriate\nemployment. In my role as Associate Director and Assistant Professor, my efforts focused on\nsystematically address education, employment, and transitional issues for persons with the full\nrange of disabilities. With my return to Kentucky as an Associate Professor of Special\nEducation, my focus has continued be on transition and employment issues for youth and adults\nwith disabilities. I have participated in a wide range of transition programs that include\nconsulting on two educational systems change grants (Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s Transition Systems Change\nProject and Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s Severe Systems Change Project). Further, in Kentucky, I have directed\nnumerous state and federally funded demonstration and research grants in transition and\nemployment. I consult with the Kentucky Board of Education and the Kentucky Association of\nSchool Boards on a variety of education issues. Until the summer of 2002 I was coordinator of\nKentucky\xe2\x80\x99s State Improvement Grant in Special Education (a federal grant designed to improve\nspecial education services throughout the state). Since then, I have directed the special education\nand distance education programs in special education, overseen numerous grants and projects,\nand taught coursework in special education.\nA.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAreas of expertise\nRehabilitation Counseling,\nPost-secondary programs\nTransition from School to post school environment,\nSecondary Programs,\nTeacher Training,\nTechnology and Assistive Technology,\nLearning & Behavior Disorders and Severe Disabilities,\nEvaluation and Design and\nSystems Change\nSpeech and Language development\n\n2\n\n\x0cVI\n\nPublications\n\na) Refereed Journals and Book Chapters\nFlexer, Baer, Luft, & Simmons, (2007).

295,Education,"b'Education Resume, Cover Letter\n& Reference Guide\nRESUME\n\nOne of the most important aspects of your job search is creating your resume. On average, administrators spend less\nthan 30 seconds screening it, so it is essential for your resume to project a clear and concise picture. The purpose of a\nresume is to market your education-related skills, experiences, and achievements so that you obtain an interview,\ntherefore you should tailor your resume to the position you want.\n\nFormatting Tips\nThere are no set rules regarding how to format your resume, however there are general guidelines you can follow when\nwriting your resume. Ultimately you are encouraged to pick the format that best highlights your skills and\naccomplishments.\nLENGTH: Education majors typically use a 2 page resume as there are a number of requirements and experiences\neducation students acquire and those should be documented on your resume.\nPAGE NUMBERS: Always include Your Name, Page 2 on the second page of your resume, in case it gets separated from\nthe first.\nPRIORITIZE: Place your most important information toward the top of the resume. You may want your first section to be\ntitled \xe2\x80\x9cTeaching Experience\xe2\x80\x9d, where you would then include your student teaching positions.\nPROOFREAD: Check and recheck for spelling and grammatical errors. Have Career & Professional Development, as well\nas someone in the teaching profession, review your resume and provide feedback.\nFORMAT: Start with a blank Word document. You may want to start by making a list of all of your experiences,\ncertifications, accomplishments. Avoid using templates because they may not allow you to easily move information or\nchange bullets, fonts, or text sizes.\nPRINTING: Print your resume on quality, white, grey or off-white paper.\nSAVE: If e-mailing your resume, use your name when saving the document. Be sure to save your resume in multiple\nlocations.\nPERSONAL INFORMATION: Do not include a photograph or other personal information such as age, weight, height,\nmarital status.\nFONT: Use easy to read fonts (Ex: Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, Cambria, etc.). Keep font sizes between 10 point and\n12 point.\nMARGINS: Keep margin widths between .5\xe2\x80\x9d and 1\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\x0cHeading\nREQUIRED CONTENT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Name: Make sure your name stands out by using a larger font (16-22 point font) and bolding it.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Address & phone number\no Include only one phone number and use a professional outgoing message on your phone (e.g.\nYou have reached the voicemail of Julie Fox, I am sorry I missed your call. Please leave your name,\nnumber and brief message and I will return your call as soon as possible. Thanks.).\no Include a campus and a permanent address if you will be in different locations during your search.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 E-mail address: A combination of your first and last name keeps your e-mail address professional (your\nSNC e-mail is good forever); remove the hyperlink.\nOPTIONAL CONTENT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Personal website/LinkedIn public profile: Include personal websites only if they are directly related to\n\nyour objective and will enhance your candidacy. You may consider creating your own online portfolio\nto highlight your subject area, classroom management plan, strong lesson plans, sample letters,\npictures of a well-organized classroom in which you worked.\n\nExample 1\n\nCampus Address:\n555 Third Street\nDe Pere, WI 54115\n\nHeading Examples\nNatalie L.

An objective is optional, however\nwhen used it can be general or specific. A general objective is most effective when attending a career fair, networking\nevent, or uploading into Hire a Knight or WECAN. A specific objective is best used when applying to a particular position\nand should be tailored every time.\nGeneral Objective: To obtain a position in the field of\xe2\x80\xa6(Early Childhood Education, Elementary School Education etc.)\nGeneral objective example: Desire a position in the field of Early Childhood Education utilizing skills in\n\npositive behavior management and a strong interest in collaborating with colleagues and parents.\n\nSpecific Objective: Desire a position as a\xe2\x80\xa6 (5th grade teacher, high school Chemistry teacher etc.) with\xe2\x80\xa6.

The purpose of a cover letter is to\npersuade the reader you are worth an interview.

Vary your sentence structure.\n\nContent\nBefore writing, first research information about the job and the school so you can address key points and needs related\nto that position, school and district. Next, reflect on your own qualifications and skills and select three that most closely\nfit the requirements of the position and/or the needs of the school and district.\nSALUTATION: Address your cover letter to a specific person if possible.

First Avenue\nStanley, WI 54768\nDear Ms. Gonzales:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere all students learn at a high level,\xe2\x80\x9d was the first thing I was drawn to while reviewing your website. One sentence,\npacked with a great deal of meaning. The strides Stanley-Boyd has made in math and reading to achieve 90% of your\nstudents passing their reading tests and 83% proficient or advanced in Math is something of which I hope to be a part. It is\nfor these reasons I would love the opportunity to join your community as a 2nd grade teacher. In May 2013 I will be\ngraduating from St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Elementary Education and\na minor in Language Arts. My strengths in building connections with students, faculty and parents, using technology to\neffectively enhance the classroom, and differentiate instruction based on the needs of my students are just a few of things I\ncan offer to Stanley-Boyd.\nSome of the ways I build strong relationships with students, faculty, and parents is through attending after school events,\nparticipating in a district meeting, and opening lines of communication via newsletters, e-mails, phone calls, and\nconferences. Two additional strengths I possess are the ability to use technology effectively and differentiate and engage\nstudents. For example, with my first grade students I used iPads during guided reading where high leveled students\nspelled sight words, middle leveled students read sight words, and lower leveled students traced letters while practicing\nletter sounds. Another example is in 8th grade advanced Language Arts where students read a novel regarding utopias.\nStudents then reflected on their own utopia, wrote about it, and then presented using WebPages, movies, or podcast.\nFinally, at the end of the year students reflected on the unit choosing their favorite piece; many chose to write about the\ntechnology.\nI am excited about this opportunity to join your team of educators, and bring my various strengths with me. I would love\nto assist Stanley-Boyd Elementary School in the continuation of being a spotlight school. Thank you for considering my\nqualifications for this 2nd grade position, I look forward to hearing from you in the near future to discuss my\nqualifications. If you would like to contact me, I can be reached at (920) 337-5555 or sam.knight@snc.edu. Again, I look\nforward to this great opportunity at Stanley-Boyd. Go Orioles!\nSincerely,\n\nSam Knight\n(Submitted Electronically)\n\nEnclosure: Resume, References\n\n\x0cREFERENCES\nThe reference page is a separate document from the resume.

Specialist III\n2545 McCarthy Mall, Bilger 101\nUniversity of Hawai\xe2\x80\x98i\nHonolulu, HI 96822\nDear Dr. Hiple:\nI am applying for the Educational Specialist position at the SLTCC/NFLRC, and have attached the UH\nForm 64 (APT Application for Employment), my current curriculum vita, and three letters of recommendation\nAs my CV indicates, I received my Master\'s degree in ESL from Temple University\'s Tokyo school. One\nof the unique aspects of this program is its Weekend Seminar series, which invites experts from all over\nthe world to do 14-hour seminars on an area of specialty. While at Temple, I took 9 credits of these\nseminars, from people such as Richard Schmidt, Sandra Savignon, Teresa Pica, and Paul Nation. I feel\nthat the variety of perspectives these seminars provided have helped make me a more rounded teacher\nand administrator.\nI have eight years of experience teaching English in Japan, to students aging from nine years old\nthrough senior citizens, and at levels from beginner through advanced. I have taught private lessons, at\nlanguage schools, at a vocational school, and at a university. I primarily taught conversation, but also\nhad courses in writing and reading. In all my conversation classes, I strived to lead more students\ntoward taking more responsibility for their learning, by giving them more control over the topics and by\nteaching and practicing conversation and communication strategies. In writing classes, I focused on\nmaking students aware of aspects of creative writing (and giving them opportunities to ""play"" with these\naspects), as well as working with them on writing essays on topics of their own choosing. Finally, in\nreading classes, I tried to use real materials (to the extent these were available) for practicing different\nskills. I also believe strongly in being a reflective practitioner, and keep a ""teaching journal"" on a regular\nbasis.\nIn addition, I served three years as an administrator at the vocational school where I taught. In this\nrole, I was in charge of hiring teachers, curriculum development, textbook selection, scheduling, and\nworking with teachers to ensure that they were sharing lesson plans and teaching insights.\nFinally, I am also interested in materials development. I am currently working on a writing textbook,\nwhich I hope to send to a publisher in the next few months. I would be happy to provide copies of\ntextbook units, or any other teaching materials you might find useful to help you make a decision.\nPlease let me know if there is anything you would like me to provide.\nI would appreciate hearing from you at your earliest convenience. Thank you again for your consideration.\nYours truly,\n\nXXXXXXX\n\n\xc2\xa9 2002 by the Second Language Teaching & Curriculum Center (TiPPS)\n\n3\n\n\x0cSAMPLE C:\nAugust 26, 1999\nPersonnel\nSLTCC/NFLRC Ed. Specialist III\n2545 McCarthy Mall, Bilger 101\nUniversity of Hawai\xe2\x80\x98i\nHonolulu, HI 96822\nDear David Hiple:\nMy name is Jim Yoshioka, and I am applying for the UH Educational Specialist III APT position\n(#92207). I feel certain that my previous educational, teaching, research, advising, administrative, and\nprofessional experiences (described in detail here and in my curriculum vitae and application), have\nwell prepared me to successfully handle the job\xe2\x80\x99s duties, responsibilities, challenges, and possibilities\nand that, if given the chance, I can be a valuable, enthusiastic, and effective asset to your center and its\nmission. I have already served the NFLRC previously as a Graduate Assistant and co-author of Tech.\nReport #18, and I hope that I will have the opportunity to work with the NFLRC once again!\nConsidering the minimum and desired qualifications for the position, I meet them in the following\nways. First of all, in terms of education, I graduated with an MA in ESL from the University of Hawai\xe2\x80\x98i\nat Manoa this past May, my scholarly paper (an interpretive qualitative study focusing on workplace\npragmatics) earning the department\xe2\x80\x99s Harry Whitten Prize for Scholarly Excellence. In addition, I also\nhold a BA in English (teaching emphasis) and a minor in Japanese from the University of California at\nDavis, these multiple perspectives on language education working together to better inform my teaching\nand curricular decision-making.\nIn terms of actual second/foreign language educational job experience, I worked for 3 years as\nan Assistant English Teacher (EFL) at 4 junior high schools in Ichihara City, Chiba Prefecture, Japan,\nwhere my main duties included researching, developing, and adapting communicative activities for the\nclassroom to develop the students\xe2\x80\x99 English listening and speaking abilities, teaching 3-4 classes a day,\nhelping with grading and test development as well as various school-wide events and activities, and\nholding city-wide teacher training seminars to improve the Japanese teachers\xe2\x80\x99 English ability.\nMore recently, I worked for 2 years as a Graduate Teaching Assistant (ESL) for the English\nLanguage Institute (ELI) at UH Manoa, where I taught both ELI 73 (Writing for Foreign Students) and\nELI 80 (Advanced Listening & Speaking). My responsibilities encompassed the full range of curriculum\ndevelopment - conducting needs analyses in my classes; updating ELI course goals and objectives and\ndeveloping professionally in departmental meetings; choosing appropriate textbooks; administering\nand rating placement exams and reporting the results to students; developing new materials and activities\non my own and in collaboration with my colleagues; creating lesson plans and teaching my students\nwith an ear to their needs and interests, with an eye to the research and multimedia technology available\nto enhance their language learning experience, and with the spirit of building on their strengths and\nimproving their weak areas through collaborative group work and individualized feedback and attention\nfrom me; and finally, evaluation of all parts of the process. Besides these 5 years of progressively\nresponsible work in foreign/second language teaching, I have also worked previously as an ESL writing\ntutor, a Japanese tutor, and a Macintosh lab assistant/writing tutor (which again reflect my educational\nbackground).\nIt is clear, however, particularly from looking at the NFLRC job\xe2\x80\x99s duties and expectations, that\napart from having the appropriate type of background, having excellent organizational, administrative,\n\n\xc2\xa9 2002 by the Second Language Teaching & Curriculum Center (TiPPS)\n\n4\n\n\x0cand communicative skills is of prime importance. I have held a number of jobs, both paid and voluntary,\nwhere I successfully brought those abilities into play. For example, as an Academic Peer Advisor for the\nDivision of Education at UC Davis, I not only met regularly with students interested in the UCD teaching\ncredential program (advising them about program prerequisites, applications, deadlines, scheduling,\nprogram options, general college requirements, etc.) but also, on my own initiative, developed a number\nof systems and resources to help the office and the advising sessions run more smoothly and effectively.\nThese included developing and writing the division\xe2\x80\x99s first newsletter for teaching credential program\nhopefuls (full of information and important reminders), maintaining the mailing list for it, keeping\nrecords of students\xe2\x80\x99 visits and concerns for future advising purposes, and revamping, compiling, and\nediting out-of-date division handouts and references for more informative, up-to-date, and effective\nadvising sessions. I received many compliments from advisees, staff, and faculty alike for my support\nservices, and after I left, they told me they had to hire two peer advisors to take my place (which they\ndid).\nMore recently, I have helped organize the Literacy for Change: Community-Based Approaches\nConference in August 1997, using Pagemaker to create its registration materials and conference booklet\nunder the direction of Dr. Kathy Davis (ESL). That very same summer, I also served as Production\nManager (and actor) for the play Katipunan: The Cry for Freedom, where my duties included publicity\nand public relations, being a liason between the director, assistant director, set designer, and costume\ndesigner, and organizing cast functions, scheduling, and so on.\nAnd finally, for the past year, I have been carrying out writing research and administrative work\nfor the Manoa Writing Program at UH Manoa including Placement Exam registration, administration,\nrating, database maintenance, and research; Writing-Intensive course designation and research; publication\nof the most recent issues of Writing Matters; website development and updating; participation in MWP\nBoard Meetings as well as system-wide Written Communication meetings; research reports; and office\nresponsibilities such as computer/server maintenance, answering faculty/student phone or in-person\nqueries, and assisting staff with routine business.\nTwo final qualifications involve competency with computers and in a foreign language. In\npractically all of the jobs mentioned throughout my application, I have used Macintosh computers\nextensively (I have one at home as well), except at the Manoa Writing Program, where we use PCs. In\nterms of programs, I have worked with the following applications: Microsoft Word, Word Perfect,\nPagemaker (word processing/publishing); SPSS, Foxpro, Excel, ISIS (database storage and analysis);\nNorton Utilities, Filemaker Pro, various anti-virus programs (file back-up and protection); Netscape,\nTelnet, Uhunix (pine, pico, aliases), HTML Writer (internet and WWW); and other miscellaneous\nprograms such as Daedalus. As for foreign language proficiency, besides receiving a minor in Japanese\n(after 4 years of study), being a Japanese tutor, and teaching and living in Japan for three years, I also\nserved as a Graduate Research Assistant for the Japanese Department at UH Manoa. For two years, I\nassisted Dr. John Haig with expanding, updating, revising, editing, and proofreading Nelson\xe2\x80\x99s JapaneseEnglish Character Dictionary for its third edition. Other graduate assistants came and went, but I was\ncontinued through the end because of my good balance of accuracy and speed.\nFor these reasons, I believe I am prepared to handle the interesting challenges and demands of\nthe job with service, a smile, and efficiency; all I ask for is the chance. I look forward to hearing from\nyou, and thank you for considering my application!\nSincerely,\n\nJim Yoshioka\n\n\xc2\xa9 2002 by the Second Language Teaching & Curriculum Center (TiPPS)\n\n5'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Check out the career advising, workshops and other resources we offer!\n\n2\n\n\x0cTeaching Resume Aesthetics, Content & Editing\nWriting a Teaching Resume is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate your resume, but\nthere are some best practices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with\nhigh quality content and a clearly written, error-free document. Teaching Resumes need to be aesthetically\npleasing, dense with relevant content and properly edited.\nAesthetics: Always remember to have a classic, professional resume. This includes the font choice, consistency ,\nan appropriate amount of white space, length and overall appearance of the resume. Teaching is a creative and\ninnovative profession; a teaching resume should be strictly professional. Professional means there should not be\nany pictures, colors or designs on your resume. Those within the education field will immediately exclude you\nfrom potential candidates if your resume has poor aesthetics and is not professional.\nContent: While aesthetic mistakes can take you out of the running for a position, the content of the resume is\nwhat will make you stand out from the crowd. Experiences you choose to include in your teaching resume should\nbe the most relevant to your target audience. Accomplishment statements are intended to expand on your relevant\nexperience and highlight your expertise. Look to page 7 for more advice on accomplishment statements.\nEditing : Editing is a necessary component of resume writing that is often underutilized. Editing is where you\nand others assure that content is accurate and aesthetics are pin point. Have as many people proofread your\nresume as possible and stop by the Career Center for an extra set of eyes! Look to page 12 for detail of Career\nCenter services and workshops specifically for Teachers!\n\x01 Reverse Chronological Order: Within each section on the resume, your experience must go in reverse\nchronological order, meaning from new to old.\n\x01 Accomplishment Statements (Bullet Points): Eliminate the pronoun \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d at the beginning of each bullet\npoint as this is assumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \xe2\x80\x9cMy duties included...\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMy\nresponsibilities were\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d . Describe achievements, rather than listing duties, quantify outcomes whenever\npossible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in teaching and transferable skills. More description on\nAccomplishment statements can be found on page 7.\n\x01 Length: With rare exceptions, student teachers and new teachers should keep their resume to 1 page. If\nyou have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing elements that are not closely related\nto teaching; Ask yourself, \xe2\x80\x9cWill this experience enhance and support my future in education and teaching?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\x01 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive by using an appropriate amount of whitespace to allow the\nreader\xe2\x80\x99s eye to rest. Using .8 inch to 1.5 inch margins is standard practice.\n\x01 Font: Use a professional font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good\nchoices. A 10-12 point font size is recommended.\n\x01 Consistency: The formatting of a resume needs to be consistent. For example, if you choose to bold a job\ntitle, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that everything lines up neatly on the page.\n\x01 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully\nread through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Editing a resume can always use\nanother set of eyes; have as many people proofread it as possible, and, come to the Career Center!\n\x01 Paper Quality: Use a high quality paper stock (24-32 lb, 25% cotton fiber, 8-1/2 x 11) when mailing your\nresume or bringing one to an interview. Use the same paper for cover letters and thank you letters. White,\nivory, or light grey are good choices.\n\n3\n\n\x0cKey Elements of a Successful Teacher Resume\nMandatory Elements\nThese elements need to appear on every teaching resume.\n\nIdentification\nNeeds to include your first and last name (should be the largest font size, but not too oversized to look out of place), contact\ninformation : phone number and professional email address, and your street address, city, state & zip code\n\nCertification\nList all certifications and when you expect to receive them: Early Childhood (Type 04), Elementary (Type 03), Secondary\n(Type 09), Special Education (Type 10), Physical Education (Type 10)\nList any endorsements you expect\nExample: Illinois Initial Elementary Certificate (Type 03), expected July 2014\nMiddle Grade Endorsement expected in Language Arts\n\nEducation\nInstitution, City, State\n(Expected) Graduation Month Year\nWrite out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations\n*Please note that all degrees are written in singular, for example: Bachelor of Arts in Elementary Education\nGPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher)\nOther possible information to include: Study Abroad, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors\n\nExperience\nExperience is mandatory and the heart of any teaching resume; however, it can be represented in a variety of ways. Choose\nthe most rich, concrete, relevant teaching experiences to put on your resume. Keep in mind that after each experience, there\nwill be bullet points (accomplishment statements) detailing your experience more fully. Refer to page 7 for more advice on\ncreating an accomplishment statement. Important Note: within each section, experiences are to be listed in reverse chronological order.\n\nTeaching Experience (Student Teaching)\nStudent teaching is your most relevant teaching experience directly out of college. Therefore, it will directly follow the education section and take up the most amount of space on a teaching resume directly after college. Include specific lesson plans,\nclassroom management skills and teaching styles that make you unique. Refer to page 7 to find out more about creating a\nproper accomplishment statement.\n\nTeaching Related Experience\nHighlight paid or unpaid experiences though which you have gained teaching related skills. Examples include, but are not\nlimited to: camp counselor, tutor, coach and nanny.\nExample:\n\nNanny, Smith Family, Chicago, IL\n\nMarch 2008-Present\n\nInteractive Field Experience\nFocus on a select few experiences in which you played an active role in the classroom and with students.\nExample:\n\nSecond Grade, Washington Elementary School, Chicago, IL\n\nSeptember 2009\xe2\x80\x93 October 2009\n\nWork/Professional Experience\nPrincipals will be most interested in your teaching experience; however, you may include skills obtained for another industry\nthat are transferable to a classroom. For example, training, collaborating or mentoring.\n\nOptional Elements\nThese are other options to include on your resume:\n\nVolunteer Experience, Leadership Experience, Honors/Activities, Special Skills and Interests,\nProfessional Development\n\n4\n\n\x0cPOOR RESUME SAMPLE\n\nJAMES WALTON\n2261 N.

Consider incorporating them, in addition to those\nthat are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your\nbulleted accomplishment statements. Some examples of transferable skills include the following:\nCLERICAL\nBookkeeping\nClassifying\nCollecting\nCompiling\nComputing\nExamining\nFiling\nOrganizing\nRecording\nWord processing\n\nCREATIVE\nDesigning\nDeveloping\nEstablishing\nIllustrating\nImagining\nImprovising\nInventing\nperforming\nRevitalizing\nVisualizing\n\nHUMAN RELATIONS\nAdvising\nAssisting\nCounseling\nEmpathizing\nFacilitating\nGuiding\nListening\nMotivating\nRepresenting\nServing\n\nPUBLIC RELATIONS\nConducting\nConsulting\nInforming\nPlanning\nPresenting\nPromoting\nRepresenting\nResponding\nResearching\nWriting\n\nRESEARCH\nAssessing\nCalculating\nCollecting\nDiagnosing\nEvaluating\nExamining\nExtrapolating\nInterviewing\nInvestigating\nSynthesizing\n\nCOMMUNICATION\nEditing\nExplaining\nInfluencing\nInterpreting\nlistening\nMediating\nPromoting\nSpeaking\nTranslating\nWriting\n\nFINANCIAL\nAccounting\nAdministering\nAllocating\nAuditing\nBalancing\nCalculating\nForecasting\nInvesting\nProjecting\n\nMANAGEMENT\nCommunicating\nConsulting\nCoordinating\nDelegating\nDirecting\nEvaluating\nLeading\nNegotiating\nPersuading\nPlanning\n\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nAnalyzing\nAppraising\nDiagnosing\nExamining\nExecuting\nPlanning\nProving\nReasoning\nRecognizing\nValidating\n\nTECHNICAL\nAdjusting\nAligning\nAssembling\nDrafting\nEngineering\nInstalling\nObserving\nOperating\nProgramming\nRepairing\n\nTRAINING\nAdapting\nCommunicating\nDemonstrating\nEnabling\nEncouraging\nEvaluating\nExplaining\nInstructing\nPlanning\nStimulating\n\nACTION VERBS\nBeginning each bulleted accomplishment statement with a strong action verb helps to highlight your successes and allows a\nreader to get a sense of your skills by scanning the page prior to reading each individual bullet point. It is a good idea to vary\nthe action verbs on your resume in order to appeal to different audiences.

These statements should explain what you did in the position, how you did it and the results of your actions.

325,Education,"b'Job & Internship Guide \xe2\x80\xa2 16-17\n\nResume & Cover Letters\nA\n\nwell crafted resume can set you apart from other candidates. Strong resumes do more than summarize your\neducational background and work history; they emphasize the results of your efforts and draw clear parallels between your\nskills and experience and an employer\xe2\x80\x99s needs.\n\nThe 5 Steps of Resume Development\nStep 1: Analyze the Position Description\n\nRead the position descriptions thoroughly and then highlight all of the keywords which indicate required and preferred skills,\nabilities, attributes, and qualifications. If an employer is looking for someone who is innovative, punctual, and attentive to\ndetail, consider using these same or similar words in your resume.\nBecause there are patterns within industries/fields, you may develop a strong resume template for a particular category of\npositions. Along these lines, it is also often appropriate to have multiple versions of your resume, which may vary in content\nand structure depending on your target.\n\nStep 2: Generate a List of Accomplishments\n\nCreate an inventory of your accomplishments\xe2\x80\x94tasks you enjoyed doing, did well, and are proud of. Include education/\ntraining, volunteer experience, jobs, projects, travel, group or team activities, and skills. There is no one formula for what to\ninclude in a resume\xe2\x80\x94Your resume should uniquely reflect you! Focus on the outcomes of your efforts, including skills you\nhave developed. Quantify your results if possible. Don\xe2\x80\x99t sell yourself short! Resumes are promotional tools.\n\nStep 3: Identify Relevant Skill Areas\n\nFrame your experience so it focuses on skills and achievements that are desirable for that particular position/field/industry.\nMake sure each accomplishment you list highlights a skill the employer is seeking, often listed in the position responsibilities\nand qualifications.\nRemember transferable skills, skills you\xe2\x80\x99ve developed that can be used in many different settings! If you are applying to\nyour first position in a field/industry, consider in detail which skills you have developed (and how) from past experiences that\nmay translate to this new environment.\n\nStep 4: Write Descriptive Phrases\n\nUsing action verbs (see p. 18), write concise phrases to describe experiences that demonstrate your relevant skills. The\naccomplishments on your resume should ultimately be targeted to address an employer\xe2\x80\x99s needs. Do your best to place them\nin order of relevance with the most relevant information as close as possible to the top.\n\nStep 5: Choose a Format\n\nWithin one page, aim to develop a focused, succinct marketing document that clearly communicates your value and relevant\nexperience and skills.\n\n15\n\ncareer.berkeley.edu\n\n\x0cA chronological resume is the most commonly used resume format. Listing your experience in reverse chronological order\n(with the most recent experiences first), this resume format accommodates all industries and levels of experience, and is\npreferred by the majority of employers and on-campus recruiters. Because a chronological resume presents your experience\nfrom most recent (relevant) to least recent (relevant), this format works especially well for students and entry- to mid-level\napplicants to demonstrate a vertical career progression. See p. 19-24 for examples of effective chronological resumes.\nAlthough a chronological resume is often a safe bet for all levels, established professionals who have multiple gaps and/\nor unusually large gaps in their employment history, who are aspiring to make a career change into a new industry, or who\nwant to promote a specific skillset may consider a skills/functional resume format or a hybrid/combination resume format as\nalternatives to the chronological resume format. If appropriate, established professionals may also move beyond a one-page\nresume.\nWhile resume templates may be tempting, they tend to be inflexible; also, employers are often familiar with them and may\nperceive you as lacking ingenuity. Find a format that works for you, and use your own words to develop content that is\nunique to you.\n\nThe Resume Bullet: How To Say It\nResume bullets should describe your skills and accomplishments, reflecting the order or priority that the employer has stated\nin their position description and requirements. Write bullet points for jobs, internships, volunteer experiences and activities\nwhere you\xe2\x80\x99ve developed skills. Consider how these bullet points highlight skills and experiences that match the position\nrequirements. Action-oriented statements highlighting your accomplishments should use concrete language and could\ninclude:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t What: What task (transferable skill) did you perform? Use action verbs! (See p. 18)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Why: Why did you perform this task? e.g. to fulfill a goal, serve a need or make your organization/company\nbetter?\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t How: Specifically how did you perform this task?

As a Training Department Intern with UCSF, I was responsible for a new\ncomputer software education program. This project allowed me to develop and refine my training and organizational skills while\ndesigning a program to teach basic software applications to users with limited experience working with computers. The success\nof this program has been so overwhelming that the department has integrated it into their new staff training course.\nThrough my experiences at UCSF, it became clear to me that training and development is an incredible passion of mine \xe2\x80\x93 whether\nI am facilitating or designing them, I aim to make all trainings innovative, effective and fun. Yahoo is known for being one of the\nbest employers to work for in the world, in part because of its innovative, inclusive and welcoming training programs. For this\nreason, I am particularly excited to be applying for this position in hopes that I may have the opportunity to contribute to such a\nreputable team in creating and providing top quality employee training.\nAlthough the enclosed resum\xc3\xa9 thoroughly outlines my education and experience, I would appreciate the opportunity to\ndemonstrate in an interview my knowledge of employee training and development, initiative, and interpersonal skills. You can\ncontact me at (650)555-5555 to set up an interview.

It is important to keep in mind that your document should be\nspecific to your experience and the position for which you are applying. You have flexibility in the choice, naming, and placement of\nsections. While your contact information and education are usually listed first, other sections can be in any order, based on your\nstrengths and the requirements of the position or opportunity. If you are unsure if you should provide a resume or a CV, you may\nwant to contact the organization directly to see which they prefer.\n\nRESUME AND CV SECTIONS\nBelow is a list of common sections you may use when creating your document.

Over the years you have developed many skills through your\ncoursework, extracurricular activities, and life experiences. Review the list below and identify which transferrable skills you have\nand reflect on how you acquired these skills. Use this information when creating your resume to describe your experiences and the\nskills gained from these experiences. For example, if you have researched a topic for class and then wrote, edited, and presented a\nfinal research paper in front of your peers, you have used skills (gathering information, writing, problem-solving, presenting) which\nare not limited to that specific academic discipline, but are transferable to many occupations.\n\nResearch and\nplanning\n\nHuman relations\n\nOrganizing,\nmanagement and\nleadership\n\nWork survival\n\nThe skillful expression\nand interpretation of\nknowledge and ideas.\n\nThe search for specific\nknowledge and the ability\nto conceptualize future\nneeds and solutions.\n\nThe use of interpersonal\nskills for resolving\nconflict, relating to and\nhelping people.\n\nAbility to supervise and\nguide individuals and\ngroups in the\ncompletion of goals.\n\nThe daily skills that\nassist in promoting\neffective production and\nwork satisfaction.\n\nSpeaking effectively\n\nPredicting\n\nDeveloping\nrelationships\n\nInitiating new ideas\n\nImplementing decisions\n\nWriting effectively\n\nCreating theories and\nideas\n\nBeing sensitive\n\nHandling details\n\nCooperating\n\nIdentifying problems\n\nListening\n\nCoordinating tasks\n\nEnforcing policies\n\nImagining alternatives\n\nConveying feelings\n\nManaging groups\n\nBeing punctual\n\nIdentifying resources\n\nProviding support\n\nDelegating\nresponsibility\n\nManaging time\n\nGathering information\n\nMotivating\n\nTeaching\n\nSolving problems\n\nSharing credit\n\nPerceiving non-verbal\nmessages\n\nCoaching\n\nSetting goals\n\nCounseling\n\nAdvising\n\nPresenting information\n\nExtracting information\n\nCooperating\n\nPromoting change\n\nAccepting\nresponsibility\n\nDescribing feelings\n\nDefining needs\n\nDelegating with respect\n\nInterviewing\n\nDeveloping evaluations\n\nRepresenting others\n\nSelling ideas or\nproducts\n\nSetting and meeting\ndeadlines\n\nEditing\n\nCreating spreadsheets\nand databases\n\nPerceiving feelings,\nsituations\n\nDecision making with\nothers\n\nOrganizing\n\nCommunication\n\nListening attentively\nExpressing ideas\nFacilitating discussions\nNegotiating\nPersuading\n\nCalculating results\n\nAsserting\n\nAttending to detail\nMeeting goals\nEnlisting help\n\nMaking decisions\nManaging conflict\n\nPage 3\n\n\x0cACTION VERBS:\nAction verbs are an effective way to begin a skills statement.

Generally a graduate resume\nshould be 2-3 full pages and a CV should be 3-5 pages long. However, based on your experiences, career field, and the position\ndescription, it could be longer or shorter. Whatever the case, only print your document on one side of the paper and include\nyour name and the page number at the top of each page.\nAvoid using a resume or CV template. This decreases your ability to personalize and make changes as your document evolves.\nYour resume or CV should be well organized, without spelling errors, and easy to read. An employer spends a short amount of\ntime reading your document\xe2\x80\x94it is imperative that the employer clearly sees the most important qualifications.\nTo organize your document, you may choose to use bold, italics, all caps, indenting, and bullets. You will want to use these\nsparingly to emphasize the most important information. Avoid pictures, graphics, non-black ink, shading, and symbols instead\nof traditional, round, solid bullet points.\nIt is a good idea to start with a 1-inch margin on each side. You can expand the margins if need be. Font size should be\nbetween 10-12 point, and you will want to choose easy to read font styles, such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Garamond.\nKeep font size and style consistent throughout your CV (except for your name, which should be a larger size).\nPresent your resume or CV on quality bond paper (20 pound)\xe2\x80\x94choose white or off-white to ensure your document is easy to\nread.\nIf you are filling out an online application where you cannot upload your document directly, keep the format simple when\nfilling in required information.\nIf you are requested to submit your documents via email, save your resume or CV and cover letter (if applicable) as attachments. Include a brief note in the body of the email stating your purpose.\n\nTIPS FOR RESUME AND CV WRITING:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nMake sure that your resume or CV is a unique and personal document. It is a great idea to look at examples of resumes or CVs\nbut also important to make it your own.\nThere are some suggestions that we provide when writing a resume or CV, but there are also options and room for choice. If\nyou give your document to several people, they may all give you different feedback. Beyond some of our strongly suggested\nguidelines, resumes and CVs are subjective.\nBe 100% honest and factual. Avoid abbreviations.\nOrganize your document so the most important information is at the top.\nDo not include a work history. Rather, include your most related experiences or those where you demonstrated a high level of\nskill.\nPersonal information, such as marital status, age, ethnicity, height, and weight should not be included.\nAvoid personal pronouns (I, my, we) and complete sentences to describe your experiences. Start your statements with action\nverbs.\nAlways proofread your resume or CV. Do not solely rely on spell check. Some employers may eliminate candidates based on\nerrors.\nIt is suggested that you tailor your resume or CV to the job description. You may have more than one version of your\ndocument depending on the positions to which you are applying . You may change the order of sections to list more relevant\nareas of your experience closer to the top.\nRemember that your resume or CV is YOUR marketing tool. Many times it is an employer\xe2\x80\x99s first impression of you. It is also a\nwork in progress that you will continually revise.\n\nADDITIONAL RESOURCES:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nVisit www.ccse.umn.edu to view our Resume Writing or Curriculum Vitae Workshops.\nVisit the CSE Career Center Resource Center to view our Resume Examples Binder and related books.\nHave your resume or CV reviewed by a CSE Career Counselor. You can email to ccse@umn.edu. If you\xe2\x80\x99d like to meet with a\nCSE Career Counselor to discuss your application materials, you can make a 30-45 minute appointment or stop by during\nDrop-In Advising and Counseling hours (paper copy only;

333,Education,"b'Education Resume, Cover Letter\n& Reference Guide\nRESUME\n\nOne of the most important aspects of your job search is creating your resume. On average, administrators spend less\nthan 30 seconds screening it, so it is essential for your resume to project a clear and concise picture. The purpose of a\nresume is to market your education-related skills, experiences, and achievements so that you obtain an interview,\ntherefore you should tailor your resume to the position you want.\n\nFormatting Tips\nThere are no set rules regarding how to format your resume, however there are general guidelines you can follow when\nwriting your resume. Ultimately you are encouraged to pick the format that best highlights your skills and\naccomplishments.\nLENGTH: Education majors typically use a 2 page resume as there are a number of requirements and experiences\neducation students acquire and those should be documented on your resume.\nPAGE NUMBERS: Always include Your Name, Page 2 on the second page of your resume, in case it gets separated from\nthe first.\nPRIORITIZE: Place your most important information toward the top of the resume. You may want your first section to be\ntitled \xe2\x80\x9cTeaching Experience\xe2\x80\x9d, where you would then include your student teaching positions.\nPROOFREAD: Check and recheck for spelling and grammatical errors. Have Career & Professional Development, as well\nas someone in the teaching profession, review your resume and provide feedback.\nFORMAT: Start with a blank Word document. You may want to start by making a list of all of your experiences,\ncertifications, accomplishments. Avoid using templates because they may not allow you to easily move information or\nchange bullets, fonts, or text sizes.\nPRINTING: Print your resume on quality, white, grey or off-white paper.\nSAVE: If e-mailing your resume, use your name when saving the document. Be sure to save your resume in multiple\nlocations.\nPERSONAL INFORMATION: Do not include a photograph or other personal information such as age, weight, height,\nmarital status.\nFONT: Use easy to read fonts (Ex: Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, Cambria, etc.). Keep font sizes between 10 point and\n12 point.\nMARGINS: Keep margin widths between .5\xe2\x80\x9d and 1\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\x0cHeading\nREQUIRED CONTENT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Name: Make sure your name stands out by using a larger font (16-22 point font) and bolding it.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Address & phone number\no Include only one phone number and use a professional outgoing message on your phone (e.g.\nYou have reached the voicemail of Julie Fox, I am sorry I missed your call. Please leave your name,\nnumber and brief message and I will return your call as soon as possible. Thanks.).\no Include a campus and a permanent address if you will be in different locations during your search.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 E-mail address: A combination of your first and last name keeps your e-mail address professional (your\nSNC e-mail is good forever); remove the hyperlink.\nOPTIONAL CONTENT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Personal website/LinkedIn public profile: Include personal websites only if they are directly related to\n\nyour objective and will enhance your candidacy. You may consider creating your own online portfolio\nto highlight your subject area, classroom management plan, strong lesson plans, sample letters,\npictures of a well-organized classroom in which you worked.\n\nExample 1\n\nCampus Address:\n555 Third Street\nDe Pere, WI 54115\n\nHeading Examples\nNatalie L.

An objective is optional, however\nwhen used it can be general or specific. A general objective is most effective when attending a career fair, networking\nevent, or uploading into Hire a Knight or WECAN.

First Avenue\nStanley, WI 54768\nDear Ms. Gonzales:\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere all students learn at a high level,\xe2\x80\x9d was the first thing I was drawn to while reviewing your website. One sentence,\npacked with a great deal of meaning. The strides Stanley-Boyd has made in math and reading to achieve 90% of your\nstudents passing their reading tests and 83% proficient or advanced in Math is something of which I hope to be a part. It is\nfor these reasons I would love the opportunity to join your community as a 2nd grade teacher. In May 2013 I will be\ngraduating from St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Elementary Education and\na minor in Language Arts. My strengths in building connections with students, faculty and parents, using technology to\neffectively enhance the classroom, and differentiate instruction based on the needs of my students are just a few of things I\ncan offer to Stanley-Boyd.\nSome of the ways I build strong relationships with students, faculty, and parents is through attending after school events,\nparticipating in a district meeting, and opening lines of communication via newsletters, e-mails, phone calls, and\nconferences. Two additional strengths I possess are the ability to use technology effectively and differentiate and engage\nstudents. For example, with my first grade students I used iPads during guided reading where high leveled students\nspelled sight words, middle leveled students read sight words, and lower leveled students traced letters while practicing\nletter sounds. Another example is in 8th grade advanced Language Arts where students read a novel regarding utopias.\nStudents then reflected on their own utopia, wrote about it, and then presented using WebPages, movies, or podcast.\nFinally, at the end of the year students reflected on the unit choosing their favorite piece; many chose to write about the\ntechnology.\nI am excited about this opportunity to join your team of educators, and bring my various strengths with me. I would love\nto assist Stanley-Boyd Elementary School in the continuation of being a spotlight school. Thank you for considering my\nqualifications for this 2nd grade position, I look forward to hearing from you in the near future to discuss my\nqualifications. If you would like to contact me, I can be reached at (920) 337-5555 or sam.knight@snc.edu. Again, I look\nforward to this great opportunity at Stanley-Boyd. Go Orioles!\nSincerely,\n\nSam Knight\n(Submitted Electronically)\n\nEnclosure: Resume, References\n\n\x0cREFERENCES\nThe reference page is a separate document from the resume.

William and Flora Hewlett Foundation (2006-2007)\nSummary of Research and Scholarship:\nI am a sociologist of higher education. Through research, writing, and teaching, I have contributed to our\nunderstanding of major changes in the academic landscape and organizational character of American higher\neducation. My work illuminates the dynamics of institutional change in several arenas\xe2\x80\x94what facilitates it and\nwhat impedes it within different types of colleges and universities\xe2\x80\x94and identifies implications for academic\nleaders who manage organizational change, knowledge change and professional socialization. Using theories\nand methods from sociology, I analyze how organizational, intellectual, political, economic, and professional\ninterests redefine the content, structure, conduct, and relative legitimacy of academic fields.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Key studies include: the emergence and institutionalization of interdisciplinary fields; dynamics of\nprofessional socialization across disciplines; tensions in restructuring during budget cuts and selective\ninvestment; the ascendance of industry logic in public higher education (1975-2000), a pivotal era of\nchanging societal expectations; forces that promote and inhibit academic collaboration.\nServing in academic leadership roles has affirmed my passion for these areas and has inspired new inquiry in\ngraduate education, leadership development, academic collaboration, and organizational change.\n2\n\n\x0cPUBLICATIONS\nBooks\nGumport, P.

The cover letter\nintroduces you and your resume to the reader, and the resume gives a more complete overview of your\nexperience and qualifications. Together, these important marketing tools show where the match is between\nyou and the position description and determine if you\xe2\x80\x99ll be interviewed.\nYour resume and cover letter must be geared to your audience. Before you start writing:\nAssess yourself. Know what skills and experience you bring to the table. Come talk!\nResearch the field so you can use its keywords in your resume and cover letters, important whether\nyour docs are being scanned by computer or read by a person. Consult our guide, Your Job Search.\nAnalyze the description of position for which you\xe2\x80\x99re applying. Notice the key skills and competencies the employer\nseeks. Identify specific examples in your resume that match these qualifications and stress these in your letter.\nGuidelines on cover letter writing begin on page 6.\n\nGetting Started on Your Resume\nWhether writing your first resume or updating a previous one, it may help to begin with a master list of all\nyour jobs, internships, campus and community activities, special courses and projects, schools attended,\ninterests, travel, and skills. All this will not end up in your final resume, but you want to be sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t leave\nout anything important. A professional resume is likely very different from your college application version.\nLength\nOne page is standard for most fields and for most students and recent graduates. This is especially important\nfor business, technology, or communications firms (advertising or publishing, for example). Employers in many\nother fields appreciate a concise and attractive one-page resume.\nA longer resume is appropriate for certain applicants and fields. For teaching, a two-page resume is\nacceptable if you have significant related experience. For fellowships, grants, or research jobs, you may need a\nCurriculum Vitae, or C.V. A resume for federal jobs is often longer than one page. Speak with a career advisor if\nyou have any questions about what format is appropriate for your needs.\nFormat\nAvoid templates or resume wizards. Your goal is to have your resume stand out in a positive way, and\ntemplate resumes often appear identical to those of many other applicants.\nArrange your education and experience in reverse chronological order, present to past. This lets your reader\neasily see your current and recent background. You may also use categories relevant to your audience, for\nexample, Public Relations Experience, Laboratory Experience, and so forth.\nSome fields require specialized resume formats. A C.V. may be needed for research, science positions, or\nfellowships. For C.V. guidelines, please see Curriculum Vitae for Academic or Research Roles. Acting,\nperformance, or studio arts majors should consult Resumes for Actors and Artists. Note that many U.S.\nemployers asking for a C.V. may actually want a resume.\n2\n\n\x0cWriting a Resume Employers Will Read\nUse action verb phrases to describe your experiences. Instead of \xe2\x80\x9cResponsibilities included training staff\xe2\x80\x9c say\n\xe2\x80\x9cTrained five new staff.\xe2\x80\x9d A list of action verbs is on page 5.\nBe concise; omit personal pronouns and \xe2\x80\x9ca,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9can,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe\xe2\x80\x9d whenever possible. Instead of \xe2\x80\x9cI created and\nmaintained a database using Excel,\xe2\x80\x9d say \xe2\x80\x9cCreated and maintained database using Excel.\xe2\x80\x9d\nStress accomplishments and results; quantify your results when appropriate. For example:\nDraft #1: Waited tables. Opened and closed restaurant.\nDraft #2: Provided customer service to patrons of high-traffic caf\xc3\xa9. Opened and closed restaurant.\nDraft #3: Provided quality customer service to patrons of high-traffic caf\xc3\xa9, serving up to 100 meals\nduring busy lunch and dinner shifts. Developed loyal return clientele. Selected by manager over more\nexperienced wait staff to open and close restaurant. Totaled up to $200 in tips per shift.\nCreate different resumes for different audiences. All fields have different keywords and expectations of\nresumes. If possible, have it reviewed by a professional in your field as well as the Lazarus Center.\nMake it clear. Avoid confusing acronyms and abbreviations. Instead of S.O.S., say \xe2\x80\x9cService Organizations of\nSmith.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s OK to use postal abbreviations for states, but be consistent.\n\nSections of a Resume\nNAME. Put it at the top, centered or flush left. Use caps, bold, and a larger font to make it stand out.\nCONTACT INFORMATION. List your current address, phone, and email on one line (saves space) or blocked.\nAlso list a permanent or forwarding address if it\xe2\x80\x99s in your search region.\nOBJECTIVE (optional). We suggest you omit an objective from your resume and state it in your cover letter.\nSUMMARY or PROFILE (optional). More experienced applicants may begin with a summary geared to the\nreader. For example: Five years communications and marketing experience in non-profit sector. Skilled\nresearcher, writer, and editor. Excellent public speaking and workshop facilitation skills. Strong fundraising\nbackground with special expertise in grant writing. Experience recruiting, training, and motivating volunteers.\n\nEDUCATION generally comes first for students and recent grads. From present to past, list school, location,\ndegree, date awarded or expected, major, minor, and concentration. Study away, other degrees, thesis, related\ncourses, projects, and research papers may be included. GPA is required for finance or consulting but optional\nfor other fields. If your combined SAT is 2100+, we suggest including it on a finance resume. List major and\ncumulative GPA if you like.\nHigh school experience is often included by first years and sophomores. Others may include it if relevant, for\nexample, if you\xe2\x80\x99re searching in the region where you attended high school or if you had significant high school\nexperience related to your objective.\nHONORS and AWARDS, if you have them, may go under Education or as a separate category.\n\n3\n\n\x0cSKILLS can include languages, computer or lab skills, equipment use, and other skills relevant to your reader.\nInclude skills under Education or as a separate category. Add relevant licensing and certifications.\nEXPERIENCE can include jobs, internships, volunteering, extracurricular activities, and course projects. From\npresent to past, list title, organization, location, and dates. (Put organizations first, titles second if you like, but\ndo so consistently.) Use specific titles such as \xe2\x80\x9cAdministrative Intern,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cIntern,\xe2\x80\x9d if your supervisor\napproves. Choose headers stressing experience in your target field, for example, Museum Experience.\nADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE (also called Supporting Experience) is an optional category for content you\xe2\x80\x99d like to\ninclude but is less directly relevant to your reader. You may use a second heading as described above.\nACTIVITIES, INTERESTS, SKILLS, TRAVEL, AFFILIATIONS. Choose headings that work for the rest of your\ncontent. Be specific. Say \xe2\x80\x9cEnjoy modern British fiction\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cEnjoy reading.\xe2\x80\x9d Listing memberships that\nreveal your race, ethnicity, religion, political affiliation, sexual orientation, or gender identity may encourage or\ndiscourage employers from interviewing you. Feel free to consult a career advisor about your resume content.\nDO NOT INCLUDE the statement \xe2\x80\x9cReferences Available on Request.\xe2\x80\x9d Instead, prepare a separate page titled\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cReferences for Your Name\xe2\x80\x9d with your references\xe2\x80\x99 names, titles, and contact info (with permission) to send if\nrequested. Personal statistics (age, height, weight) and a photograph are only appropriate for a performance\nresume. Marital status is never included on a resume.\nINTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WISHING TO WORK IN THE US should use their Smith address and/or a US\naddress if you have one rather than an international address. Do not include your current visa status or\ncountry of citizenship. It is illegal for employers to ask about these topics in the US, though they may ask\nwhether you have work authorization or will require visa sponsorship in the future. If you are a Permanent\nResident we suggest including this in a final \xe2\x80\x9cActivities and Additional Background\xe2\x80\x9d section. Questions? Please\nsee a career advisor about your resume and the international student advisor about work status regulations.\n\nMaking Your Resume Attractive and Easy to Read\nSelect a font size and style that are easy to read. We suggest 10-12 point size in familiar fonts such as Arial,\nTimes New Roman, or Garamond. Try a slightly larger font for headings and name.\nAdjust the margins to fit your content. 1.0\xe2\x80\x9d margins are typical, but not a strict requirement.\nUse capital letters, bold type, italics, underlining, bullets, and spacing for emphasis.\nBe consistent with spacing, dates, punctuation, and order of information. Details matter!\nProofread your resume carefully. Don\xe2\x80\x99t rely on spell check. Misspellings, grammar and punctuation errors,\nand inconsistencies make a poor first impression. You may not be asked for an interview as a result.\nFor hard copy resumes, use bond paper (24 # weight is suggested) in white, cream, or gray. Use the same\npaper for your letters and get matching envelopes. If using a watermarked paper, get the mark right-side up.\nUse a letter quality printer with a fresh cartridge.\nKeep your resume polished and up-to-date.

Your cover letter needs to show what makes you a great\nfit for the position. It is not sufficient to say you have the skills required for the position or are interested in it.\nFirst, research the field and organization. Go beyond the website\xe2\x80\x94use press releases, journal/news articles,\nannual reports, Google, LexisNexis, and informational interviews with alums and others. Knowledge of the\norganization shows your initiative and enthusiasm for working there.\nReview the job description; notice the skills sought and field-specific terms used. Identify specific examples\nfrom your resume that demonstrate how you\xe2\x80\x99ve used the skills the employer wants. Stress accomplishments\nand results rather than simply listing your day-to-day responsibilities.\nWhenever possible, address your letter to an actual person, not ""To Whom it May Concern."" Phone or\nemail to get the recipient\xe2\x80\x99s name and title if it\xe2\x80\x99s not included in the position description. If you can\'t get a\nname, use a title such as ""Dear Director"" or ""Dear Internship Coordinator.""\nThe cover letter is a sample of your writing and communication skills. It must be clear, concise, and free of\nspelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Keep it simple. Dense, academic language or slang are\ninappropriate\xe2\x80\x94this is a business letter.\nTailor each cover letter. Employers may receive dozens or even hundreds of applications for any given\nposition. Careful research, relevant examples, and specific reasons why this position and this organization\ninterest you will help distinguish your application.\n\nFraming Your Story: Questions to Guide Your Cover Letter\nUse the following to generate content for your cover letter. Though it need not answer every question, a\ngreat letter will address many of these items and show you\xe2\x80\x99ve considered the others:\nWhy are you interested in this position? This organization? This field/industry?\nFor what position are you applying?\nWhat do you know about the organization, its work, clients/customers/products that especially\ninterests you?\nWhat do you feel distinguishes this organization from its peers?\nWhat specific skills and knowledge is the employer seeking for this position?\nHow have your prior experiences influenced your interest in this position/organization/field?\nIn what ways have your accomplishments during your prior experiences (extracurricular, volunteer,\nwork, other) prepared you to excel in this position?\nWhat aspects of your academic experience will help you succeed in this position?\nCompared to other applicants, how might you be uniquely qualified for the position?\nHow will the organization benefit from hiring you?\nHaving difficulty answering any of these questions? Revisiting the job description, further research, and\nclarifying your skills and interests may help.\n6\n\n\x0cCover Letter Format\nUse standard business letter format for your letter. Refer to the following page for guidelines on address\nformat, greeting and closing, and spacing.\nA cover letter should be no more than one page. Keep the paragraphs short and easy to read. Use a 10-12\npoint font size in the same font style as your resume. Set the margins so the letter is visually balanced on the\npage (1\xe2\x80\x9d is standard). For hard copy applications, use matching resume-weight paper and envelopes, and sign\nyour letter in black ink. If using stationery with a watermark, be sure it is facing the correct way.\n\nEmailing Cover Letters and Resumes\nAlways follow an employer\xe2\x80\x99s preference when emailing your resume and cover letter. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t know an\nemployer\xe2\x80\x99s preference, send your resume and letter as attached PDFs labeled with your name (ex: Jane Doe\nresume.). In the subject line say \xe2\x80\x9cResume and cover letter for children\xe2\x80\x99s trade division editorial assistant\nposition (#498).\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf sending your letter as an attachment, make the email message short:\nDear Ms. Nunez:\nI am a senior English major at Smith College with administrative and publications experience\ninterested in the children\xe2\x80\x99s trade division editorial assistant position (#498) advertised on\nbookjobs.com.

Through participating in\ndeal calls as part of the Financial Institutions Group team, I gained an understanding of how client needs are\nbest met under the pressure of time. Currently as treasurer of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s Student Government Association, I\nadminister financial transactions for 120+ student organizations and oversee a $500,000 budget,\nresponsibilities which draw on my attention to detail and ability to balance multiple priorities.\nI\xe2\x80\x99m attracted to the firm\xe2\x80\x99s practice of bringing together a flat hierarchy of diverse team members, each with\nthe opportunity to make a difference through creative problem solving, as this is how I\xe2\x80\x99ve discovered I work\nbest. Barclays Capital\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to service projects such as mentoring at-risk students and serving food\nin local shelters appeals to me to given my volunteer experience with our local Big Sisters program. The\nfirm\xe2\x80\x99s client-centered philosophy and global market position combined with the opportunity to contribute to\nthe community make Barclays Capital an exciting place to build my career.\nI welcome the opportunity to talk with you about my qualifications, experience, and interest in the analyst\nprogram at Barclays Capital. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from\nyou.\nSincerely,\nMargot Perlman\n\n17\n\n\x0cMARGOT PERLMAN\nSmith College, 1 Chapin Way, Unit 0000, Northampton, MA 01063, 413.585.1111, margot.perlman@gmail.com\nEDUCATION\nSMITH COLLEGE, Northampton, MA\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Major: Economics\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Candidate for Bachelor of Arts in May 2016\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cumulative GPA: 3.7; SAT: 2200\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Relevant Coursework: Econometrics, Statistics, Money and Banking, Financial Accounting, International Finance,\nGame Theory, International Trade and Commercial Policies\nUNIVERSIT\xc3\x89 DE GEN\xc3\x88VE, Geneva, Switzerland; Smith College J unior Year Abr oad Pr ogr am, 2014-2015\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GPA: 3.8\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Relevant Coursework: International Money and Finance, Political Economy of International Finance\nEXPERIENCE\nMORGAN STANLEY, New York, NY\nInvestment Banking Intern\nSummer 2015\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Helped prepare pitch books for client presentations, including shareholder information, earnings vs. expectations\ncharts, and indexed stock pricing graphs as member of Financial Institutions Group team; participated in deal calls\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Built financial models for leveraged buyouts and credit review\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Researched potential investors, buyers, and acquisition targets\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Used Bloomberg to prepare graphs on daily market performance and earnings estimates\nNEW YORK CITY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, New York, NY\nSummer 2014\nInternal Audit Intern\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reviewed and analyzed legal documents to synchronize fiscal information among departmental databases\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Prepared audit information to be sent to independent auditors at close of fiscal year\nLEADERSHIP\nSMITH COLLEGE STUDENT GOVERNMENT ASSOCIATION (SGA)\n2015-Present\nTreasurer\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Write SGA\xe2\x80\x99s budget for fiscal year; manage all accounting transactions for 120+ student organizations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Oversee application and allocation process of three SGA Cabinet funds for student body at large; assist\norganizations with fiscal needs\nStudent Finance Committee Member\n2013-2014\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Allocated $500,000 student activities budget for college\xe2\x80\x99s student organizations as part of 15-person team\nBANGS COMMUNITY CENTER, Amherst, MA\n2013-2014\nBig Brother/Big Sister Volunteer\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Created and implemented programs and activities for five children in kindergarten through fifth grade\nADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE\nLAZARUS CENTER FOR CAREER DEVELOPMENT

In addition to my work experience, I recently completed a course in\ndrug/pharmacology terminology at the University of the Sciences in Philadelphia.

The book is designed for introductory American Government courses, and therefore\ncovers, in depth, the framers, constitutional theory, institutions, and participation \xe2\x80\x93 while\nsimultaneously engaging with a student population who may be only vaguely interested in\ngovernment.\nLinking Science to Decision Making in Environmental Policy: Bridging the Disciplinary Gap (coauthored with Lawrence Becker, The MIT Press, under contract)\nThis book examines the role of science in moderating interest-based politics in resource\nmanagement and environmental stewardship. The manuscript builds a model of science based\npolicy processes where management decisions are based on stakeholder input but constrained\nby scientific efficacy. Ultimately, the project is intended to develop a protocol to maximize crossdisciplinary decision making in environmental policy.\nEnvironmental Deceptions: The Tension between Liberalism and Environmental Policymaking in\nthe United States (with Kristy Michaud; Albany: State University of New York Press, 2nd edition\nunder contract)\nThis book brings together normative analyses and empirical data to explain the structural\nlimitations liberal society places on environmental improvement. I argue that cultural\nambivalence toward communitarian ethics has made the traditional environmental\ninfrastructure problematic. The book exposes the subtle tensions that often lead to policy\nfailure, and suggests that traditional policy models are insufficient to resolve existing\nenvironmental dilemmas in air, water, waste, and energy.\n\nPublications: Books\nPublic Policy: The Essential Readings (edited with Stella Theodoulou; Pearson, 2012).\n2nd edition.\nRethinking California: Politics and Policy in the Golden State (co-authored with H.

357,Education,"b'Education Resume, Cover Letter\n& Reference Guide\nRESUME\n\nOne of the most important aspects of your job search is creating your resume. On average, administrators spend less\nthan 30 seconds screening it, so it is essential for your resume to project a clear and concise picture. The purpose of a\nresume is to market your education-related skills, experiences, and achievements so that you obtain an interview,\ntherefore you should tailor your resume to the position you want.\n\nFormatting Tips\nThere are no set rules regarding how to format your resume, however there are general guidelines you can follow when\nwriting your resume. Ultimately you are encouraged to pick the format that best highlights your skills and\naccomplishments.\nLENGTH: Education majors typically use a 2 page resume as there are a number of requirements and experiences\neducation students acquire and those should be documented on your resume.\nPAGE NUMBERS: Always include Your Name, Page 2 on the second page of your resume, in case it gets separated from\nthe first.\nPRIORITIZE: Place your most important information toward the top of the resume. You may want your first section to be\ntitled \xe2\x80\x9cTeaching Experience\xe2\x80\x9d, where you would then include your student teaching positions.\nPROOFREAD: Check and recheck for spelling and grammatical errors. Have Career & Professional Development, as well\nas someone in the teaching profession, review your resume and provide feedback.\nFORMAT: Start with a blank Word document. You may want to start by making a list of all of your experiences,\ncertifications, accomplishments. Avoid using templates because they may not allow you to easily move information or\nchange bullets, fonts, or text sizes.\nPRINTING: Print your resume on quality, white, grey or off-white paper.\nSAVE: If e-mailing your resume, use your name when saving the document. Be sure to save your resume in multiple\nlocations.\nPERSONAL INFORMATION: Do not include a photograph or other personal information such as age, weight, height,\nmarital status.\nFONT: Use easy to read fonts (Ex: Times New Roman, Arial, Calibri, Cambria, etc.). Keep font sizes between 10 point and\n12 point.\nMARGINS: Keep margin widths between .5\xe2\x80\x9d and 1\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\x0cHeading\nREQUIRED CONTENT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Name: Make sure your name stands out by using a larger font (16-22 point font) and bolding it.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Address & phone number\no Include only one phone number and use a professional outgoing message on your phone (e.g.\nYou have reached the voicemail of Julie Fox, I am sorry I missed your call. Please leave your name,\nnumber and brief message and I will return your call as soon as possible. Thanks.).\no Include a campus and a permanent address if you will be in different locations during your search.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 E-mail address: A combination of your first and last name keeps your e-mail address professional (your\nSNC e-mail is good forever); remove the hyperlink.\nOPTIONAL CONTENT\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Personal website/LinkedIn public profile: Include personal websites only if they are directly related to\n\nyour objective and will enhance your candidacy. You may consider creating your own online portfolio\nto highlight your subject area, classroom management plan, strong lesson plans, sample letters,\npictures of a well-organized classroom in which you worked.\n\nExample 1\n\nCampus Address:\n555 Third Street\nDe Pere, WI 54115\n\nHeading Examples\nNatalie L.

An objective is optional, however\nwhen used it can be general or specific. A general objective is most effective when attending a career fair, networking\nevent, or uploading into Hire a Knight or WECAN.

In May 2013 I will be\ngraduating from St. Norbert College in De Pere, Wisconsin with a Bachelors of Arts degree in Elementary Education and\na minor in Language Arts. My strengths in building connections with students, faculty and parents, using technology to\neffectively enhance the classroom, and differentiate instruction based on the needs of my students are just a few of things I\ncan offer to Stanley-Boyd.\nSome of the ways I build strong relationships with students, faculty, and parents is through attending after school events,\nparticipating in a district meeting, and opening lines of communication via newsletters, e-mails, phone calls, and\nconferences. Two additional strengths I possess are the ability to use technology effectively and differentiate and engage\nstudents. For example, with my first grade students I used iPads during guided reading where high leveled students\nspelled sight words, middle leveled students read sight words, and lower leveled students traced letters while practicing\nletter sounds. Another example is in 8th grade advanced Language Arts where students read a novel regarding utopias.\nStudents then reflected on their own utopia, wrote about it, and then presented using WebPages, movies, or podcast.\nFinally, at the end of the year students reflected on the unit choosing their favorite piece; many chose to write about the\ntechnology.\nI am excited about this opportunity to join your team of educators, and bring my various strengths with me. I would love\nto assist Stanley-Boyd Elementary School in the continuation of being a spotlight school. Thank you for considering my\nqualifications for this 2nd grade position, I look forward to hearing from you in the near future to discuss my\nqualifications. If you would like to contact me, I can be reached at (920) 337-5555 or sam.knight@snc.edu. Again, I look\nforward to this great opportunity at Stanley-Boyd. Go Orioles!\nSincerely,\n\nSam Knight\n(Submitted Electronically)\n\nEnclosure: Resume, References\n\n\x0cREFERENCES\nThe reference page is a separate document from the resume.

The\nexample resumes in this guide will help you choose effective formatting and layout styles, but\nyou still may wish to sit down one-on-one with a Career Advisor to help decide what content\nto include in your resume. For individual assistance, contact Career Services to set up an\nappointment at 419.530.4341.\nBelow are some general suggestions to help get you started:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIf you choose to utilize an objective, include the grade levels and/or subjects you are\nprepared to teach and list a few important skills you have to offer. \xe2\x80\x9cTo obtain a teaching\nposition\xe2\x80\x9d is not specific enough. Remember, you do not have to use an objective.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nList your Licensure (state, specific subjects and grade levels) near the top of your resume,\neither in the objective or under the \xe2\x80\x9cEducation\xe2\x80\x9d section.

Just be sure that you have at\nleast a half page of information on page two, put your name at the top in small print, and\nnumber it so that if the pages are separated they can be matched up again.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nList your references in a separate document, with your name and contact information at\nthe top.\n\n\x0cSchool Address:\n333 S.

Drawing from my\nexperiences as a student teacher and substituting in various classrooms, I welcome the chance to begin my\nprofessional teaching career at Gesu. I noticed a second grade position listed on the website, and as highlighted\nin my enclosed resume, my academic achievement, related teaching experience, volunteer involvement and past\nemployment demonstrates that I possess the qualifications to begin my teaching career.\nDuring my student teaching experience I implemented lessons that were age appropriate, hands-on and\nindividualized. I developed work pages that dealt with the spelling and writing of \xe2\x80\x9clightning words\xe2\x80\x9d which\nprovided the building blocks for each students\xe2\x80\x99 own Lightning Word Dictionary. In the classroom, I constructed\ndifferent centers for the children to explore, including a nature pavilion, a space odyssey and an alphabet\nadventure. In the \xe2\x80\x9cMad about Math\xe2\x80\x9d center, I encouraged students to take the Math Challenge, using\nmanipulatives to solve simple addition and subtraction problems.\nA personal goal of mine is to provide my students with a stimulating, challenging, and healthy learning\nenvironment that will allow them to become active in their learning experience. In order to do that, I must also\neffectively communicate with students, faculty, parents, and administrators. As a student teacher I developed a\nparent e-newsletter to help distribute information and collect feedback on homework assignments.\nBeing an involved student and active member in various organizations, as well as working part-time throughout\ncollege, required perseverance and good time management skills. While teaching is a demanding career, I am\nconfident my experiences have prepared me to succeed.\nI am interested in meeting with you to discuss my qualifications for the second grade position at Gesu School. I\nwill contact you within two weeks to arrange an interview at your earliest convenience. Thank you for\nreviewing my credentials as a potential candidate and considering me for your teaching staff.\nSincerely,\n\nAdeline Streudel\n\n\x0cBernadette Peters\n1111 Sugar Crest Circle\nToledo, Ohio 43608\nDecember 1, 2003\nMr. Wonderful Superintendent\nToledo Public Schools\n1919 Manhattan\nToledo, Ohio 43608\nDear Mr. Superintendent:\nHaving completed my student teaching experience with 9th through 12th grade\nstudents at Rogers High School, I look forward to teaching social studies in Toledo\nPublic Schools. I have lived in Toledo all my life and I am fully aware of the school\ncommunity, its history and its future. As highlighted in my resume, my related\nteaching experience, academic achievements and my involvement with youth of all\nages prove my qualifications to begin a rewarding teaching career.\nTeaching Social Studies has given me an opportunity to communicate with a diverse\ngroup of people, which has influenced the lessons and teaching strategies I\nimplement in the classroom. For example, in a lesson on the Civil Rights Movement, I\nplaced numerous signs around the classroom forbidding the students from doing\ncertain activities. In order for the signs to be removed, the students had to form\ncommunity action groups similar to those in the Civil Rights Movement, decide on a\ncause in which to fight for, and make protest signs to prepare for a peaceful\ndemonstration. Finally, the students marched around the outside of the school, sang\nsongs and gave speeches that had to convince me to take down the signs.\nThrough involvement with various youth activities outside of the school, I have\nlearned how to develop activities that will stimulate the minds of the students. I have\nalso had a chance to hear concerns and suggestions from both parents and\nstudents that will help me develop an effective classroom environment. And as a\nconcerned citizen, I feel that it is necessary for students to be involved with extracurricular activities. To that end I look forward to advising or co-advising\norganizations that stimulate a positive after school environment for students.\nThank you for taking time to read and consider my application. I will follow-up with\nyou before the end of the month, hopefully to set up a convenient time to discuss\npotential positions.\nSincerely,\n\nBernadette Peters\n\n\x0c612 South Main Street\nSwanton, OH 43558\nJanuary 19, 2004\nPenelope Winters\nSylvan Learning Center\nHolland, OH 43528\nDear Ms. Winters:\nHaving just completed my degree in Early Childhood Education, I am seeking a teaching\nposition to begin my career in Education. Through researching Sylvan Learning Centers, I\nhave come to find that the center\xe2\x80\x99s mission coincides with my own beliefs about teaching for\nthe students\xe2\x80\x99 maximum individual benefit. The Sylvan Advantage is innovative and effective - customizing education programs to meet each and every child\xe2\x80\x99s unique needs.\nTeaching to a wide variety of developmental levels has provided me with the opportunity to\ndevelop a diverse repertoire of teaching strategies. I can effectively design and implement\nindividualized activities that address different learning styles, including strategies for verbal,\nvisual and kinesthetic learners. I have developed lesson plans incorporating educational\nkinesiology and guided reading, and have experience with students with dyslexia,\ndyscalculia, dysgraphia and ADHD.\nBeing a full time student as well as working part-time to pay my tuition throughout college\nrequired perseverance and good time management skills. While teaching is a demanding\ncareer, I am confident that my life experiences have prepared me for success.\nI am interested to meet with you to discuss my qualifications for a teaching position in your\ncenter. Thank you for taking the time to review my resume, and I will contact you within two\nweeks to see if you are interested in arranging an interview at your convenience. Feel free to\ncontact me with any questions you may have.\nSincerely,"\n\nBethany Whitacre'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Functional resumes enable candidates to highlight\ntransferable skills, placing less emphasis on employment dates, job titles, and\nemployers.\n\nVI.\n\nAdditional Career Center Resume Resources\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6...Page 14\n\n2\n\n\x0cI. Resume Purpose, Design, & Mechanics\nThe purpose of a resume is to market yourself to employers by succinctly summarizing your education, experience,\nand skills, ultimately aiming to convince employers to invite you to interview. When conceptualizing your resume,\nthink of it as a marketing tool, rather than a simple work history, as it is intended to promote you as the perfect\ncandidate for the opportunity at hand.\nResume writing is an art, not a science. There is no one correct way to formulate a resume, but there are some best\npractices and standards that the Career Center recommends. Stand out from the crowd with high quality content\nand a clearly written, error-free document. Sequence the information from most important to least important with\nregard to your career objective. When constructing bullet points, aim to highlight accomplishments that exemplify\nthe skills you possess and employers are seeking.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Length: With a few rare exceptions, when applying for internships or entry-level jobs, students should\nkeep their resume to 1 page. If you have difficulty narrowing down your resume, consider removing\nelements that are not closely related to the opportunities for which you are applying.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Margins: Make your resume visually attractive. Use some whitespace to allow the reader\xe2\x80\x99s eye to rest.\nUsing .5 inch to 1.5 inch margins is recommended.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Font: Use a font that is easy to read. Times New Roman, Arial, and Courier New are good choices. A\n10-12 point font size is recommended.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Consistency: Keep the formatting consistent throughout your resume. For example, if you choose to bold\na job title, make sure you bold every job title. Also, make sure that all of your bullet points, section headers,\ndates, etc. line up neatly on the page.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Accuracy: Your resume, and all other job search materials, must be 100% error free. Be sure to carefully\nread through your resume, checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation. It is a good idea to have at least\n2-3 people proofread it as well.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Be Accomplishment-Orientated: Employers hire you for your skills and want to read about times when\nyou have successfully utilized the skills they are seeking. Describe achievements, rather than listing duties,\nquantify outcomes whenever possible, and be sure to highlight your proficiency in both technical (industry\nor job function-specific) and transferable skills.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Use Action Verbs: Strengthen your bullet points by beginning each with an action verb that previews the\nskill to be exemplified in that accomplishment statement. This allows a potential employer to more easily\nscan your resume for what he or she is seeking.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Make it Clear and Be Succinct: Eliminate the pronoun \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d at the beginning of each bullet point as this is\nassumed. Avoid introductory and wind-up phrases such as \xe2\x80\x9cMy duties included...\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cMy responsibilities\nwere\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xef\x81\xb6 Overall Appearance: Ask yourself and others if your document is easy to read and professional looking.\nAlso, consider that the average recruiter may scan your resume for 30 seconds or less. Make sure that your\nmost important information stands out.\n\n3\n\n\x0cII. Key Elements of a Successful Resume\nYour First and Last Name\n\xe2\x99\xa6 Phone number \xe2\x99\xa6 Email address \xe2\x99\xa6 Street address \xe2\x99\xa6 City, state & zip code \xe2\x99\xa6\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOBJECTIVE\nCreate a statement describing or naming the position you are seeking to obtain. You may also include the specific field or area\nyou are interested in and the skills and expertise you could contribute to the company. This section is optional and could be\nomitted or substituted with a \xe2\x80\x95Career Highlights\xe2\x80\x96 or \xe2\x80\x95Summary of Qualifications\xe2\x80\x96 section.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEDUCATION\nInstitution City, State\n(Expected) Graduation Month Year\nWrite out the full name of your (expected) degree; also list Minors and Concentrations\nGPA: 4.0/4.0 (it is recommended that you include your GPA if it is 3.0 or higher)\nOther possible information to include: Study Abroad experiences, Relevant Coursework, or Academic Awards and Honors.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nEXPERIENCE, RELEVANT EXPERIENCE, INTERNSHIP EXPERIENCE [possible titles/descriptive headings]\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nThe position header above is one example of formatting. Other formats can include using two lines or rearranging the order of\nthe Organization, Job Title, Location, and Dates to emphasize the most important elements.\nYou can bold or italicize your title or your organization\xe2\x80\x94whichever is more relevant, but be consistent.\nIn this section include bulleted accomplishment statements, which provide examples of times you have successfully used the\nskills employers are seeking.\nStart with a strong action verb, then follow with an explanation of what you were doing, describe how you did it, and, when\npossible, include any outcomes that you achieved. Remember, statements should ultimately convey your proficiency in one or\nmore skill sets of interest to the employer by way of providing an example of when you have used them.\nConsider the following questions to help you create more effective bullet points: What was the result/outcome of your work?\nWhat were your accomplishments? How did you help the organization? What skills/knowledge did you enhance? How does\nthis experience relate to your internship/employment goal?\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nBulleted statements should be in the proper tense (past or present tense) and use consistent grammar and punctuation.\nBe specific by including quantity, frequency, population, and impact of your work whenever possible.\nMake sure your resume is easy to read and not too text heavy. Avoid using colors, multiple fonts, pictures, being too brief, or\nmaking it too dense. Make it your own, but be professional.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nADDITIONAL EXPERIENCE, LEADERSHIP, HONORS, ACTIVITIES, COMMUNITY SERVICE, VOLUNTEER,\nPROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT [possible titles/descriptive headings]\nOrganization, Your Job Title \xe2\x80\x93 City, State\nMonth Year - Month Year\nUsing multiple experience sections is optional and allows you to emphasize (by placing it closer to the top) your most relevant\nexperience. Experiences within a section should be listed in reverse chronological order.\nPositions within this section should be formatted like previous experience sections, but may or may not include bullet points.\nIn an additional experience section, you can include work experiences that may not be directly related to the job you are\napplying to, but add to your credibility by exemplifying a progressive work history.\nEmphasize your transferable skills, those that can be taken from one experience and applied elsewhere.\nOrganization, Your Role (e.g. Member, Participant, Honoree, or Presenter) \xe2\x80\x93 City, State Month Year - Month Year\nThis section can also be an opportunity to share your experiences as a leader, honors received, community involvement,\nprofessional development activities, or membership in organizations. As illustrated, replace \xe2\x80\x95job title\xe2\x80\x96 with the role you played.\nIncluding bullet points is optional, depending on what you wish to convey to a potential employer.\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nADDITIONAL SKILLS [List skills that are testable and concrete. Soft skills such as communication, organizational, and\ninterpersonal skills should not be listed here, but rather incorporated into your bulleted accomplishment statements above.]\nTechnology: Try to include programs that would not be assumed based on education and include your proficiency level. For\nexample: Advanced User of Microsoft Office Suite, including Outlook, Excel, and PowerPoint, as well as Adobe Photoshop.\nLanguages: For example: Proficient in oral and written German; Beginner knowledge of Spanish.\n\n4\n\n\x0cIII. Transferable Skills & Action Verbs\nTRANSFERABLE SKILLS\nTransferable skills are those that can be applied in multiple work settings. Consider incorporating them, in addition to those\nthat are specific to your intended career field, by providing examples of when you have successfully used them in your\nbulleted accomplishment statements. Some examples of transferable skills include the following:\nCLERICAL\nBookkeeping\nClassifying\nCollecting\nCompiling\nComputing\nExamining\nFiling\nOrganizing\nRecording\nWord processing\n\nCREATIVE\nDesigning\nDeveloping\nEstablishing\nIllustrating\nImagining\nImprovising\nInventing\nperforming\nRevitalizing\nVisualizing\n\nHUMAN RELATIONS\nAdvising\nAssisting\nCounseling\nEmpathizing\nFacilitating\nGuiding\nListening\nMotivating\nRepresenting\nServing\n\nPUBLIC RELATIONS\nConducting\nConsulting\nInforming\nPlanning\nPresenting\nPromoting\nRepresenting\nResponding\nResearching\nWriting\n\nRESEARCH\nAssessing\nCalculating\nCollecting\nDiagnosing\nEvaluating\nExamining\nExtrapolating\nInterviewing\nInvestigating\nSynthesizing\n\nCOMMUNICATION\nEditing\nExplaining\nInfluencing\nInterpreting\nlistening\nMediating\nPromoting\nSpeaking\nTranslating\nWriting\n\nFINANCIAL\nAccounting\nAdministering\nAllocating\nAuditing\nBalancing\nCalculating\nForecasting\nInvesting\nProjecting\n\nMANAGEMENT\nCommunicating\nConsulting\nCoordinating\nDelegating\nDirecting\nEvaluating\nLeading\nNegotiating\nPersuading\nPlanning\n\nPROBLEM SOLVING\nAnalyzing\nAppraising\nDiagnosing\nExamining\nExecuting\nPlanning\nProving\nReasoning\nRecognizing\nValidating\n\nTECHNICAL\nAdjusting\nAligning\nAssembling\nDrafting\nEngineering\nInstalling\nObserving\nOperating\nProgramming\nRepairing\n\nTRAINING\nAdapting\nCommunicating\nDemonstrating\nEnabling\nEncouraging\nEvaluating\nExplaining\nInstructing\nPlanning\nStimulating\n\nACTION VERBS\nBeginning each bulleted accomplishment statement with a strong action verb helps to highlight your successes and allows a\nreader to get a sense of your skills by scanning the page prior to reading each individual bullet point.

I learned about this\nopportunity after reading the job posting on the UT Kinesiology Career Services website. I am\ncurrently in the process of attaining my alternative certification with \xe2\x80\x9cI Teach Texas\xe2\x80\x9d while\nworking full time at the University of Texas at Austin. I have included my resume and reference\nlist for your review.\nI decided to go into the field of physical education because I want to make a difference in the\nlives of students as an educator and a role model. Being a former D-1 softball player at UT, I\nhave high-level sport experience, skills and passion for sports and physical activity. I believe\nthat I am well prepared to begin my career in teaching in numerous ways. As the head coach of\na 16-and-under girls\xe2\x80\x99 softball team in Austin, I learned how to communication effectively with\ndiverse personalities of players, parents, and tournament organizers.

383,Advocate,"b'The Basics of a Legal Resume\nThe goal of the legal resume is to get an interview. To do this, your resume must present clearly\nand concisely the reasons why you are a great candidate. In other words, the legal resume is\npersuasive writing.\nA good legal resume accomplishes three major tasks:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nTo present your background and experience to emphasize how well you meet the\nrequirements of the position.\nWhich parts of your education, work and life experience are most pertinent to the job\nrequirements? How should you describe them? If you have non-legal work experience,\nwhat experience should you include and how do you describe it to emphasize the skills\nthat appeal to legal employers?\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nTo do so concisely and in an easy to read, proper legal format.\nEmployers typically screen resumes in 30-60 seconds. A legal resume has a specific\nformat that allows reviewers to see the most important information easily within this time\nframe. Review the \xe2\x80\x9cLegal Resume Samples\xe2\x80\x9d for examples.\nLegal resumes are typically one page, unless you have substantial professional\nexperience, or the position requires a more detailed resume, such as an intellectual\nproperty or academic position.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nTo convey a sense of who you are as an individual and as a potential employee.\nYou can do this by including information on personal interests, community involvement,\nor other relevant experiences. Personal interests should be interesting to catch the\nreader\xe2\x80\x99s attention. This can often be a conversation starter in an interview and can help\nattorneys remember you as a candidate.\n\n\x0cWriting a Good Legal Resume\nYou can simplify the process of writing the legal resume if you follow this approach:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nBrainstorm all the experiences you have had using the \xe2\x80\x9cLaw School Resume\nWorksheet,\xe2\x80\x9d at the end of this publication. The next step is to list your skills,\nqualifications, and accomplishments. Update your resume as you continue to gain legal\nexperiences, and on an annual basis after you graduate from law school.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nRead the qualifications preferred for the position. When you apply for a position, read\nthe detailed job description to target your resume/cover letter as much as possible to\nmatch the employer\xe2\x80\x99s desired qualifications.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nConsider the overall appearance of your resume. Is the layout professional and easy\nto read? Is there enough white space? Is it free of grammar and spelling errors? Are the\nverb tenses consistent? Do the headers highlight your experience, such as, \xe2\x80\x9cLegal\nExperience\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness Experience?\xe2\x80\x9d Because templates restrict the resume\xe2\x80\x99s\nstyle/formatting and often do not highlight your information in the best way, we\nrecommend that you avoid using resume templates. See the \xe2\x80\x9cLegal Resume Samples\xe2\x80\x9d\n(found in the Symplicity Document Library in the Symplicity Document Library) which\ndemonstrate good examples of legal resumes.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nBe succinct in your writing style. Use short, dynamic, descriptive phrases rather than\nlong sentences or paragraphs. Keep it to one or two pages, preferably one, unless you\nhave extensive relevant experience.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nBegin sentences with action verbs. Examples of action verbs would be: drafted,\norganized, counseled, researched and evaluated. Stress skills, accomplishments, strengths\nand qualifications. Do not use the same verbs repeatedly to describe your experience.\nCheck out the \xe2\x80\x9cAction Verbs\xe2\x80\x9d in the Symplicity Document Library for more suggestions.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nDraft the resume. Use these suggestions to help in this process. Remember, anything\nyou put on your resume you may be asked about in an interview, so be sure it is accurate.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nHave a draft of your resume reviewed. By submitting your first resume in Symplicity,\nit will automatically be reviewed by career staff. You may schedule an appointment with\na career advisor to review your resume. It may also be helpful to ask a mentor or\nprofessional in your job target area to review your resume for technical accuracy. Then,\nmake your final revisions and proofread well.\n\n\x0cRESUME CONTENT\nThe legal resume lists sections on education, legal and other experience, and may include other\ncategories such as personal interests or community involvement. The main goal of your resume\nis to present the most relevant information about you within a limited space.\nHEADER\n\nName, address, phone number, and email (preferably your Mitchell Hamline\naddress).\n\nTIPS:\nMake sure the header is easy to read. Your name should be a large font size (14-16 pt). There are\nmany ways to save space on your resume, for example: your phone number and email address\ncan be written on one line in the header. Add a symbol (~ or other symbol) to separate your\naddress, phone and email address. Remove the hyperlink in your email address by using a right\nclick of the mouse.\nMake sure that your contact information (address, phone, and email) is current. Employers will\nuse this information to contact you if they want to schedule an interview. Make sure that your\nvoicemail messages and e-mail addresses are professional and that you check these on a regular\nbasis.\nHEADER EXAMPLES:\n\nSusan A. Johnson\n1122 Grand Avenue, St. Paul, MN 55105\n651-699-1234 ~ susan.johnson@mitchellhamline.edu\n\nSusan A.

Include\nactivities and honors from both undergraduate school and law school. List your GPA / Class\nRank / and Top % of class, especially if you are participating in On-Campus Interviewing (OCI).\n\n\x0cEDUCATION ENTRY EXAMPLES:\nMitchell Hamline School of Law, St. Paul, MN\nJuris Doctor expected, June 2018\nG.P.A.: 2.97 Class Rank: 100/300 (Top 33.3%)\nHonors: Mitchell Hamline Law Review, Staff Member Vol. 40\nMitchell Hamline School of Law, St. Paul, MN\nJuris Doctor expected, June 2018\nGPA: 3.32 Class Rank: 20/220 (Top 9.1%)\nHonors: CALI Award (highest grade in class) for Constitutional Law and Evidence; Dean\xe2\x80\x99s\nList (two semesters)\nActivities: International Law Student Organization; Student Bar Association, Section\nRepresentative\nMitchell Hamline School of Law, St. Paul, MN\nJuris Doctor expected, June 2018\n\xef\x82\xb7 Dean\xe2\x80\x99s Honor Roll, 2 semesters\n\xef\x82\xb7 International Law Student Organization\n\xef\x82\xb7 Student Bar Association, Section Representative\nGustavus Adolphus College, St. Peter, MN\nBachelor of Arts, cum laude, Physics, G.P.A. 3.35, June 2014\nHonors: Physics Department Award of Merit; All-Conference Soccer Team\nActivities: Physics Club (President); Varsity Soccer; Student Senate (Chair)\nConcordia College, Moorhead, MN\nBachelor of Arts, magna cum laude, Business, May 2012\nHonors: Dean\xe2\x80\x99s List (every semester); Merit-Based Academic Scholarships\nActivities: Student Senate Standards Board, Chair; Residence Hall Assistant; Intramural\nVolleyball\nTIPS:\nSpell out Degrees: Juris Doctor and Bachelor of Arts; magna cum laude and summa cum laude\nare Latin and written in italics with small letters (no capitals).\nLaw Review: Mitchell Hamline Law Review (Staff member, 2016) Law Review should be\nwritten in italics (if using subheadings, list Law Review within you law school honors\nsubsection).\nGrades and Class Rank: This should match what is on your transcript. Do not round your GPA\nor class rank to your advantage. A class rank of top 10.4% does not round up to top 10%, and a\nGPA of 2.9 is not a 3.0.\n\n\x0cLaw School Activities: Legal employers are interested in seeing leadership roles you have held.\nList student organizations and any offices held or committee membership roles.\nAcademic Honors: Include CALI Awards, Burton Awards, Dean\xe2\x80\x99s List and other selections.\nInclude moot court/mock trial competitions and any honors you achieved (final competition\nteam, best brief, etc.) List law journal membership, any publications, and offices held. Include\nscholarships awarded on the basis of merit.\n\nEXPERIENCE\nThis section highlights your experience (paid or unpaid, including internships and volunteer\nexperience) demonstrating your qualifications for the job.\nIf you have one or more legal experiences, you may want to title this section \xe2\x80\x9cLegal Experience.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIf you have extensive prior work experience, you may want to select titles that reflect your\nexperience such as: \xe2\x80\x9cBusiness Experience,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cTechnical Experience,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPublic Service\nExperience.\xe2\x80\x9d\nResumes may use either a bulleted or paragraph format. Bulleted points may be easier to read,\nbut may take up more space. Always use strong action verbs to begin each phrase. Use the\npresent tense for current jobs and past tense for previous jobs. Refer to the \xe2\x80\x9cAction Verbs\xe2\x80\x9d and\n\xe2\x80\x9cLegal Resume Samples\xe2\x80\x9d for further examples\nTIPS:\nRemember that volunteering for MJF, research assistantships with Mitchell Hamline professors,\nclinics, legal internships and externships are all legal experiences, as is work at a private law firm\nor other legal settings before and during law school. This work does not have to be paid work.\nDescribe the kinds of legal issues and experiences you were involved in, the types of legal\ndocuments you wrote, the level of responsibility you had and the results accomplished. Do not\nmerely list the job tasks. Make your work experience come alive with well chosen detail and\ndescription.\nFor non-legal jobs, emphasize those aspects of your job that intersected with legal issues, such\nas: Negotiated contracts on _______ and provided clients with advice to obtain health care under\ncomplex federal, state and local regulations. Emphasize your transferable skills, for example,\nskills valued in the legal arena: Problem solving, oral and written communication, research and\nanalysis in complex situations, client/customer service, and obtaining results.\n\n\x0cWhenever appropriate, and significant, use numbers and percentages to quantify\naccomplishments (for example: Supervised 12 employees; increased sales by 25%; managed\nbudgets of $1-2 million).\nEXAMPLES:\nLindquist & Vennum, P.L.L.P., Summer Associate, Minneapolis, MN, Summer 2015\nResearched and drafted over 10 memoranda on legal issues, including lost profits, attorneys\xe2\x80\x99\nfees, credit loan participation, and liability of corporate officers for patent infringement.\nDrafted documents for marital dissolution, including interrogatories, requests for admission,\naffidavits and court briefs. Updated an arbitration clause for use in client contracts.\nWells Fargo N.A., Minneapolis, MN (June 2010 - August 2013)\nSenior Loan Account Representative. Managed accounts for 20 clients who maintained more\nthan $10 million in commercial loan transactions. Analyzed and presented trends information\nto senior bank management. Researched and assessed the impact of new federal bank\nregulations on clients and on compliance activities of the bank.\nSouthern Minnesota Regional Legal Services, Mankato, MN, May \xe2\x80\x93 July 2014\nVolunteer Law Clerk\n\xef\x82\xb7 Researched tenant rights issues, including the right to cure, HUD Section 8 rules, giving\nproper notice before eviction and the landlord\xe2\x80\x99s duty to repair.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Advised as many as 20 clients per day regarding legal housing issues.\n\xef\x82\xb7 Advocated with HUD on behalf of four clients to resolve compliance issues.\n\nINTERESTS OR COMMUNITY SERVICE\nThis section shows a sense of you as a person, in a way that will be likely to help you connect\nwith a legal employer.\nTIPS:\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cInterests\xe2\x80\x9d section is optional but can be more interesting by providing some details. For\nexample: \xe2\x80\x9cTraveled in East Asia\xe2\x80\x9d vs. simply \xe2\x80\x9cTravel.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPublications, Language or Licenses/Certifications (CPA, Rule 114 neutral, etc.) could be\nadditional headings that show specific skills. If you are active in professional organizations or\nhave been published, you may also want to include those.\n\n\x0cSPECIAL TOPICS\nCertain topics are \xe2\x80\x9chot button\xe2\x80\x9d topics\xe2\x80\x94those that may create a negative impression on the\nresume reviewer, based on the reviewer\xe2\x80\x99s own background and beliefs. These topics include\npolitics, social fraternities, religion, sexual preferences, and issues that are currently being\ndebated by society.\nThere are three ways to handle these issues in a resume: 1) list the activities 2) list activities in a\nneutral way 3) or, do not include these on your resume. It is your choice whether or not to\ndisclose activities or experiences that reflect your beliefs/values. These can be listed as follows:\nMinnesota Law Students for (Democrat/Republican) Candidate (Then list activities.)\nState Chairman, Law Student Organization, for presidential candidate (Then, list activities, as\nyou choose.)\nSPECIAL RESUMES: OCI, Judicial Clerkship, IP and Public Interest\nCertain resumes require a different emphasis.\nJudicial Clerkship: Emphasize Moot Court, Judicial externships, Law Review, research and\nwriting experiences, including any publications.\nOn-Campus Interviews (OCI): Include your GPA, Class Rank, and (Top __%), Law Review,\nand all other academic achievements.\nPublic Interest: Public interest employers are particularly interested in things that show a\ncommitment to public service and connections to the greater community, particularly in the area\ndealt with by that employer. Include a separate section with volunteer work and community\ninvolvement. In the cover letter, you will also want to emphasize how and why your\ncommitment to this kind of public interest opportunity arose.\nIntellectual Property (IP): IP employers are often looking for a specific technical background.\nList details about the technical aspects of your education and experience, including publications\nand research projects. These resumes can be longer than one page.\n\n\x0cFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\nCan I use my nickname on my resume if that\xe2\x80\x99s what I prefer to be called? Use your full\nlegal name and write your nickname in parentheses or quotation marks. (For example: Elizabeth\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetsy\xe2\x80\x9d Roberts). If your nickname doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem professional, do not use it on your resume.\nShould I use an \xe2\x80\x9cobjectives\xe2\x80\x9d statement? Most legal resumes do not include an objectives\nstatement. Mention the position you are applying for (and why) in your cover letter.\nShould my resume be only one-page? Legal employers prefer to see a concise resume. Most\nlaw student resumes are one page. If you have extensive professional experience or a technical\nbackground it may be appropriate to have a two-page resume. If your resume is two pages, make\nsure that your name is on the second page (Robin Hood, page 2), but omit the complete header.\nHow important is formatting? Make your resume inviting and easy to read by using white\nspace wisely. Do not overuse bold, italics, or underlined text because it may make your resume\nappear busy. (For example: Bold the names of educational institutions and employers, but do not\nbold the city, state, and dates).\nDo I need to list my GPA and Class Rank? How do I explain if my grades are not in the top\n___ % of my class? Most law firms want to see your GPA and class rank. Emphasize the\npositive. If your grades show an upward trend, show both cumulative GPA and the trend:\nCumulative GPA: 2.9; GPA: 3.4 (second year). If you received a high grade in a class that\npertains to the position, you may list it (this could also be highlighted in the cover letter as well.)\nShould I include my undergraduate activities and honors? Legal employers are typically\nmost interested in your law school experience. Select the most relevant honors and activities. If\nyou received a substantial scholarship related to your academic performance, you can say\n\xe2\x80\x9cPresidential Scholarship\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cAcademic scholarships\xe2\x80\x9d\nHow should I list clinics, competitions, and other experiences? List clinics, internships and\ncompetitions after you have been accepted or have started the experience. Do not list clinics or\ncompetitions you anticipate taking. If you want to emphasize courses relevant to the position,\nsuch as IP courses, you could include this in a sub-category \xe2\x80\x9cCourse Highlights\xe2\x80\x9d in the\nEducation section (in addition to your cover letter).\nWhere do I list clinics and MJF experience? Clinic participation and volunteering with MJF\nare important legal experiences \xe2\x80\x93 include these under the \xe2\x80\x9cLegal Experience\xe2\x80\x9d section to provide\nmore visibility.\nWhat about Study Abroad? Study abroad can also set you apart from other students. You can\nadd a \xe2\x80\x9cStudy Abroad\xe2\x80\x9d section as an activity under the college or university you attended.\n\n\x0cEXAMPLE:\nStudy Abroad: London, England (May-June 2015)\nEmphasis: Comparative Contracts and Alternative Dispute Resolution.\nIf the study abroad was sponsored by another university, you may also list the name of that\nUniversity.\nDo I need to list every job on my resume? List the jobs that are pertinent to the position. You\ndo not need to list every single position. There should not, however, be large unexplained time\ngaps in your resume.\nWhat if I was promoted or had several jobs with one company? You can list the company\ninformation once, and then list each separate position with a description. See examples in the\n\xe2\x80\x9cLegal Resume Samples\xe2\x80\x9d found in the Symplicity Document Library.\nWhat if my only experience is non-legal? Describe your accomplishments and results.\nEmployment at Starbucks during the rush hours says a lot about your ability to handle pressure\nand provide good customer service. Describe non-legal experiences focusing on transferable\nlegal skills. We also recommend gaining legal experience through MJF, externships, or clinics to\nadd legal experience to your resume.\nShould I list undergraduate internships? Some college internships provide excellent\nexperience and make you stand out to an employer. These should be listed under activities.\nAs a second career student, how do I describe my experience? Focus on your transferable\nskills, selecting the most relevant experiences. Be careful that your descriptions do not use\njargons or acronyms that are unfamiliar to legal recruiters.\n\n\x0cLaw School Resume Worksheet\nUse this worksheet to assist you in brainstorming all of the possible experiences to list on your resume. All resumes\nshould have contact information, education and experience sections, but content will differ greatly, depending on\nyour unique background. A resume is a targeted marketing piece about you, with the employer as your audience.\nThink about what you can do for the employer, with an emphasis on your skills and accomplishments, rather than on\nduties and responsibilities.\n\nSchool Name: ________________________________________________________________________\nLocation of School (City & State) _______________________________________________________________\nExpected Graduation Date: ____________________________________________________________________\nGPA: ______________ Class Rank: _____/____ (Top______%) (List GPA and Class Rank if in top 40-50%)\nScholarships/Awards/Honors (may include a brief explanation):\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nExtracurricular Activities (student organizations, CLE classes, publications, and presentations) Be sure to list all\nleadership roles within these organizations:\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\nWhat Made Me Stand Out?

400,Advocate,"b'Killer Legal Resumes\nResumes are an individual expression of who you are. They are also your one chance to make\na great first impression. The idea is to set yourself apart from the rest of the crowd, while still\nmaintaining the traditional professionalism required in the field of law.\nRemember, the resume is not a complete autobiography! It is a prospectus for the future. Its\nmain task is to convince prospective employers to contact you for an interview. A good resume\nshould:\no\no\no\n\nBe eye-appealing\nHighlight your significant accomplishments\nBe logically displayed for a 30-second (or less) review\n\nIdentify Your Skills\nIt is sometimes difficult to fully and effectively inventory and evaluate your own skills profile. Ask\nyourself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat special abilities have I developed which allowed me to perform successfully in\nmy previous activities/jobs?\xe2\x80\x9d Do not be concerned that you have little or no previous experience\nin legal jobs. Job skills are transferable. For example, the communications skills learned in a\nretail position will be useful in your future legal career when counseling clients. Categorize your\nskills as follows \xe2\x80\x93 all three categories are important and highly valued by employers!\no\n\nTechnical/Professional Skills \xe2\x80\x93 skills that are related to performing within a job and\nacquired by education, training, reading, and/or hands-on experiences (i.e., internships,\nclerkships, volunteer opportunities). These skills are often listed in advertised job\npostings: e.g., legal research abilities, writing skills, working knowledge of a certain area\nof law (e.g., Uniform Commercial Code).\n\no\n\nFunctional Skills \xe2\x80\x93 skills related to people, information, and things that are transferable\nfrom one field to another (e.g., organization, communication, management, leadership).\nThese abilities are easy to overlook or downplay, but are highly valued by prospective\nemployers and crucial to successful workplace performance.\n\no\n\nPersonal/Adaptive Skills -- skills often referred to as personality and/or character traits\n(e.g., patience, decisiveness, team player, self-starter, quick learner, detail-oriented,\nwork well under pressure).\n\nInventorying your Experiences/Resume Content\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHeading (name, address, email, telephone)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEducation/Honors/School-Related Activities (reverse chronological order)\no Education typically begins with college.\no List degree/year obtained or expected; names and locations of schools.\no Include your GPA if 3.0 or higher; class rank if in the top one-third\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCertificates/Licenses/Bar Admission(s)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProfessional/Work Experience\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Be specific! Include title, months and years of employment, name and location of\nemployer.\n\n\x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Instead of automatically listing job duties for each job, try to write\n""accomplishment statements"" that single out and spotlight your major\nachievements. Accomplishment statements are far more compelling than a list of job\nduties and responsibilities.\nThink back on your previous positions and highlight any experiences that represent\nachievements. To pinpoint achievements, some people think in terms of baseball and\nask, ""What were my triples and homeruns in that job?"" Once you identify the triples\nand homeruns, write out an explanation of what you did. For additional help on how to\nwrite accomplishment statements, go to www.careerlab.com/art_homeruns.htm.\nIt may be helpful to describe each experience using a P-A-R (Problem-Action-Result)\nformula. Describe the Problem (or challenge/responsibility) you faced in the position,\nAction(s) you took to reach an objective/goal, and the Result or accomplishment.\nContrast the effectiveness of these two statements:\nBasic/Generic Description\n\nUsing P-A-R Formula\n\nPerformed legal research and\ndrafted a response to a motion\nfor summary judgment\n\nDrafted successful opposition to\npivotal motion for summary\njudgment in personal injury case\ninvolving more than $10 million\nin damages\n\nList job duties where accomplishment statements are not feasible. Obviously, no\none hits triples and homeruns in every job. If you don\'t have any significant\nachievements in a particular job, it is perfectly acceptable to list your job duties and\nresponsibilities, but it need not be an exhaustive list. Stick to the more significant\nones that will be meaningful to the reader. A list of sample phrases for job duties as\nwell as accomplishment statements is included below.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUse action verbs to start each statement and omit personal pronouns (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d or\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy\xe2\x80\x9d). A list of action verbs is included below.\nQuantify number of people, products, profits involved (e.g.,\xe2\x80\x9d Supervised 15-20\ncommunity volunteers\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVolunteer, clinical, and/or internship experience\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This may be your strong point! Always consider how you can \xe2\x80\x9cput your best foot\nforward\xe2\x80\x9d, presenting yourself as an experienced, capable candidate.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProfessional Memberships/Activities/Publications\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSpecial skills (fluency in a foreign language; advanced computer skills if truly beyond\nthose skills expected)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nActivities/Interests (extracurricular activites, hobbies, interesting pursuits)\n\nFormat\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOne page (unless you have significant work experience, e.g. career before law school,\nhigh level responsibility, etc.)\nProfessional, clean, easy-to-read typeface\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Standard 12 pt. font\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reasonable margins\n\n\x0c\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPrinted on high quality paper (limit color to white, cream, pale gray)\nUse space to highlight information and make it easy to read\n\nTips and Traps\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTailor your resume to the specific employer\no Be sure to include skills and experience sought by the employer\nProofread (for accuracy, grammar, punctuation, and correct telephone number)\nNo personal information! (i.e. marital status, children, etc.)\nHave two other people proofread (perfection is key)\nBefore including anything on your resume, ask yourself this: Does this information\nsignificantly contribute to your presentation? If not, exclude it.\nExclude photograph\nMake sure that your voice-mail message is appropriate\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t list references on your resume. Have a separate list available if requested. It is\nimportant to select people as references who are familiar with your work skills. Ask\nformer employers or colleagues. Include their full names, job titles and addresses, along\nwith phone numbers and email addresses.\n\nSample Job Duty Phrases for Law Clerk and\nGeneral Legal Experience\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nResearched issues pertaining to pending motion to dismiss in complex civil litigation\ncase\nResearched and drafted memoranda on discrete issues of law including \xe2\x80\xa6 (piercing the\ncorporate veil, 1933 Act securities regulations, CERCLA, etc.)\nAssisted in discovery including drafting deposition questions, interrogatories and\nrequests for production of documents\nDrafted settlement letters\nDrafted and edited articles of incorporation, by-laws and articles of merger\nCommunicated with opposing counsel and clients\nAttended federal pre-trial conferences and court proceedings\nAttended depositions in commercial foreclosure proceedings\nAttended various client meetings regarding x, y, and z\nDrafted corporate resolutions and partnership agreements\nDrafted lease agreements\nPrepared due diligence for complex civil litigation case\nResearched and drafted bench memoranda, orders and opinions on various issues of\ncriminal law, such as \xe2\x80\xa6 (preliminary injunctions, order to produce documents, etc.)\nReviewed motions, researched relevant case law, prepared summaries of legal\narguments and assisted in preparation of court rulings\nPrepared and filed documents in (dependency and neglect proceedings, probate case)\nConducted in-take interviews of prospective clients\n\nSample Accomplishment Statements\nfor Law Clerk and General Legal Experience\nDrafted complaint in complex contract case involving dispute over multi-million dollar\nparcel of real estate\nPrepared settlement agreement to resolve $30,000 construction contract case between\ngeneral contractor and property owner\n\n\x0cDrafted and edited successful motions to dismiss and motions for summary judgment\ndefending claims for workers\' compensation involving potential liability for permanent,\ntotal disability payments\nInvestigated and developed factual basis for motion for restraining order for victim\nadopted by assistant district attorney in presenting case and relied on by court in issuing\norder\nSuccessfully represented indigent, Spanish-speaking woman from Columbia in all\naspects of a two day asylum hearing before a federal immigration judge; client granted\nasylum as a result\nWrote and edited a legal manual on domestic violence distributed to law enforcement\nofficers and battered women\xe2\x80\x99s shelters throughout the state\nDrafted speeches on x, y, and z delivered in committee and subcommittee meetings by\nCongressman\nArgued more than a dozen sentencing and bond reduction hearings for misdemeanor\ndefendants resulting in favorable decisions by the court in all cases\nObtained a sentence reduction for client in criminal case from one year to ninety days in\njail\nResearched and drafted successful motion to suppress evidence in criminal case\nresulting in dismissal of several charges\nDrafted motion for partial summary judgment that was filed in case involving the\nEndangered Species Act resulting in the inclusion of a species of Colorado trout on the\nendangered species list\nDeveloped factual and legal premise to support dismissal of frivolous trespassing suit,\nsaving client potential damages exceeding $10,000\n\nAction Verbs for Resumes\nA list of action verbs to assist you in describing your experiences and accomplishments:\n\n\x0c\x0cProviding Substance to Your Resume\nDuring your three years in law school, build up your resume through the\nfollowing:\nParticipating in clinics and internship programs\no Student Law Office\no Corporate Internship Program\no Internships for Credit\no Other Clinical Programs\nGet involved in student and volunteer activities, including student\norganizations\nResearch assistant for a professor\no Great way to improve your research and writing skills\nPart- and full-time legal positions\no Work during your summers (full-time) and possibly during the school\nyear (part-time) after your first year if your schedule will allow\nConcentrate on your grades\nApply to writing competitions\nParticipate in moot court competitions, such as Barrister\xe2\x80\x99s Cup and\nNegotiations Competition\nJoin the American Bar Association (ABA), the Colorado and Denver Bar\nAssociations (CBA & DBA) as a student member.

411,Advocate,"b'Killer Legal Resumes\nResumes are an individual expression of who you are. They are also your one chance to make\na great first impression. The idea is to set yourself apart from the rest of the crowd, while still\nmaintaining the traditional professionalism required in the field of law.\nRemember, the resume is not a complete autobiography! It is a prospectus for the future. Its\nmain task is to convince prospective employers to contact you for an interview. A good resume\nshould:\no\no\no\n\nBe eye-appealing\nHighlight your significant accomplishments\nBe logically displayed for a 30-second (or less) review\n\nIdentify Your Skills\nIt is sometimes difficult to fully and effectively inventory and evaluate your own skills profile. Ask\nyourself: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat special abilities have I developed which allowed me to perform successfully in\nmy previous activities/jobs?\xe2\x80\x9d Do not be concerned that you have little or no previous experience\nin legal jobs. Job skills are transferable. For example, the communications skills learned in a\nretail position will be useful in your future legal career when counseling clients. Categorize your\nskills as follows \xe2\x80\x93 all three categories are important and highly valued by employers!\no\n\nTechnical/Professional Skills \xe2\x80\x93 skills that are related to performing within a job and\nacquired by education, training, reading, and/or hands-on experiences (i.e., internships,\nclerkships, volunteer opportunities). These skills are often listed in advertised job\npostings: e.g., legal research abilities, writing skills, working knowledge of a certain area\nof law (e.g., Uniform Commercial Code).\n\no\n\nFunctional Skills \xe2\x80\x93 skills related to people, information, and things that are transferable\nfrom one field to another (e.g., organization, communication, management, leadership).\nThese abilities are easy to overlook or downplay, but are highly valued by prospective\nemployers and crucial to successful workplace performance.\n\no\n\nPersonal/Adaptive Skills -- skills often referred to as personality and/or character traits\n(e.g., patience, decisiveness, team player, self-starter, quick learner, detail-oriented,\nwork well under pressure).\n\nInventorying your Experiences/Resume Content\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHeading (name, address, email, telephone)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEducation/Honors/School-Related Activities (reverse chronological order)\no Education typically begins with college.\no List degree/year obtained or expected; names and locations of schools.\no Include your GPA if 3.0 or higher; class rank if in the top one-third\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCertificates/Licenses/Bar Admission(s)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProfessional/Work Experience\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Be specific! Include title, months and years of employment, name and location of\nemployer.\n\n\x0c\xe2\x80\xa2 Instead of automatically listing job duties for each job, try to write\n""accomplishment statements"" that single out and spotlight your major\nachievements. Accomplishment statements are far more compelling than a list of job\nduties and responsibilities.\nThink back on your previous positions and highlight any experiences that represent\nachievements. To pinpoint achievements, some people think in terms of baseball and\nask, ""What were my triples and homeruns in that job?"" Once you identify the triples\nand homeruns, write out an explanation of what you did. For additional help on how to\nwrite accomplishment statements, go to www.careerlab.com/art_homeruns.htm.\nIt may be helpful to describe each experience using a P-A-R (Problem-Action-Result)\nformula. Describe the Problem (or challenge/responsibility) you faced in the position,\nAction(s) you took to reach an objective/goal, and the Result or accomplishment.\nContrast the effectiveness of these two statements:\nBasic/Generic Description\n\nUsing P-A-R Formula\n\nPerformed legal research and\ndrafted a response to a motion\nfor summary judgment\n\nDrafted successful opposition to\npivotal motion for summary\njudgment in personal injury case\ninvolving more than $10 million\nin damages\n\nList job duties where accomplishment statements are not feasible. Obviously, no\none hits triples and homeruns in every job. If you don\'t have any significant\nachievements in a particular job, it is perfectly acceptable to list your job duties and\nresponsibilities, but it need not be an exhaustive list. Stick to the more significant\nones that will be meaningful to the reader. A list of sample phrases for job duties as\nwell as accomplishment statements is included below.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nUse action verbs to start each statement and omit personal pronouns (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x9d or\n\xe2\x80\x9cmy\xe2\x80\x9d). A list of action verbs is included below.\nQuantify number of people, products, profits involved (e.g.,\xe2\x80\x9d Supervised 15-20\ncommunity volunteers\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVolunteer, clinical, and/or internship experience\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This may be your strong point! Always consider how you can \xe2\x80\x9cput your best foot\nforward\xe2\x80\x9d, presenting yourself as an experienced, capable candidate.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nProfessional Memberships/Activities/Publications\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSpecial skills (fluency in a foreign language; advanced computer skills if truly beyond\nthose skills expected)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nActivities/Interests (extracurricular activites, hobbies, interesting pursuits)\n\nFormat\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOne page (unless you have significant work experience, e.g. career before law school,\nhigh level responsibility, etc.)\nProfessional, clean, easy-to-read typeface\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Standard 12 pt. font\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Reasonable margins\n\n\x0c\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPrinted on high quality paper (limit color to white, cream, pale gray)\nUse space to highlight information and make it easy to read\n\nTips and Traps\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTailor your resume to the specific employer\no Be sure to include skills and experience sought by the employer\nProofread (for accuracy, grammar, punctuation, and correct telephone number)\nNo personal information! (i.e. marital status, children, etc.)\nHave two other people proofread (perfection is key)\nBefore including anything on your resume, ask yourself this: Does this information\nsignificantly contribute to your presentation? If not, exclude it.\nExclude photograph\nMake sure that your voice-mail message is appropriate\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t list references on your resume. Have a separate list available if requested. It is\nimportant to select people as references who are familiar with your work skills. Ask\nformer employers or colleagues.

430,Advocate,"b'RESUME\nWILLIAM P. ALLISON\n\nCAREER SUMMARY\nFor thirty-two years, Bill Allison has practiced and taught law in Austin, Texas. He began his\ncareer as a lawyer with the Community Legal Services Program, a law office sponsored by The\nUniversity Of Texas School Of Law. When the program was absorbed by the Travis County\nLegal Aid and Defender Society in 1972, he became a Legal Aid lawyer. In both these positions\nhe supervised law students in one of the Law School\xe2\x80\x99s earliest \xe2\x80\x9cclinical\xe2\x80\x9d programs, what today is\ncalled an externship.\nIn 1975, Mr. Allison was recruited to be a full time Lecturer at the UT School Of Law, teaching\nand supervising students in the newly formed Criminal Defense Clinic (CDC). The CDC was the\nLaw School\xe2\x80\x99s first true clinic with an academic component. In 1977, Mr. Allison and a student\nattorney appealed one of the Clinic\xe2\x80\x99s early cases, a free speech case, to the United States Supreme\nCourt and won. Also in 1977, Mr. Allison opened his first private practice in Austin,\nconcentrating on federal and state criminal defense, while remaining on the faculty half-time as a\nLecturer to continue teaching and supervising CDC students. He began teaching trial advocacy\nfor the National Institute for Trial Advocacy in 1978 and has taught more than fifty, one- to threeweek trial advocacy courses for lawyers and for law students at various venues around the nation.\nIn Fall 1995, Mr. Allison was invited to teach a seminar entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cFranz Kafka and the Systems\nof Punishment\xe2\x80\x9d in the Plan II Honors program at UT. He taught that course through the fall\nsemester of 2002, then turned the course over to the Hon. Robert Pitman, a UT Law School and\nCDC graduate, and now a United States Magistrate for the Western District of Texas. Mr. Allison\nretired from the la w school faulty after the summer semester, 2002, and has devoted himself to\nhis private practice. In January 2004, Mr. Allison returned to teaching full time as a Clinical\nProfessor of Law and Director of the Criminal Defense Clinic.\nFrom 1993 to 1999, Mr. Allison served as Editor-in-Chief of Voice for the Defense, the monthly\nmagazine of the Texas Criminal Defense Lawyers Association. He is recognized in The Best\nLawyers in America. In June, 2001, he was named \xe2\x80\x9cBest Defense Lawyer of the Year\xe2\x80\x9d for 20002001, by the Criminal Justice Section of the State Bar of Texas. In November 2003, Texas\nMonthly Magazine named him one of the \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Lawyers of Texas\xe2\x80\x9d (a peer reviewed award) and\none of the top fifty (50) lawyers for Central and West Texas. He has been listed in Woodward &\nWhite\xe2\x80\x99s Best Lawyers in America since 1996, and has been \xe2\x80\x9cA/V\xe2\x80\x9d rated by Martindale -Hubble\nfor over twenty years.\nIn recent years, Mr. Allison has worked to obtain the exoneration of innocent individuals who\nhave been wrongfully convic ted, cases of actual innocence. He and a team of lawyers recently\nwon the release of a young man who had spent more than 12 years in prison for a murder he did\nnot commit. Mr. Allison also won the exoneration for another innocent man who had spent 16\nyears in prison for a sexual assault he did not commit. Recently, he was part of the team that won\na $5.3 million civil rights settlement for one of these exonerated individuals. He has just\nachieved the commutation of a death penalty case in Texas for a mentally retarded man. This was\na court appointed case on which he worked for over six years.\nIn the Fall of 2003, along with David Sheppard and Prof. Robert Dawson, Mr. Allison\nincorporated the Texas Center for Actual Innocence as a Section 501 (c) (3) tax-exempt, non-\n\n1\n\n\x0cprofit corporation to find and assist actually innocent inmates who are serving long-term or death\npenalty sentences. Through the generous cooperation of the UT School Of Law and the Austin\nlaw firm of Graves Daugherty Hearon and Moody, the Center has prepared a syllabus, written a\nmanual, recruited an initial class of ten students out of fifty applicants, and screened the first\ninmate requests. This hybrid class is privately funded, with little or no cost to the law school.\nCURRENT\nPrincipal, Law Office of William P.

432,Advocate,"b'19 Legal CVs\nGuidelines\nClear headings with different text size help the reader find the information they want. Fancy\nstyles and fonts are better suited to CVs for creative jobs\nA two page CV is normally expected. Early in your degree when you have limited experience,\nyou might want to use a single-sided CV for speculative applications\nPutting your name in a footnote can help avoiding the pages getting separated when the\nemployer prints it out. If printing yourself, use good quality white or cream paper\nLaw firms will expect your applications to be error free. Spell-check helps but don\xe2\x80\x99t rely on it\nand pay attention to punctuation and appropriate use of capital letters. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to pick up your\nown errors, so try asking a friend to proof read for you\nRecruiters like to find dates easily. One way is to put dates at the left margin, followed by the\nname of the employer or place of study and job title or qualification obtained. Try to do this\nacross a single line\nStyle guides can ensure consistency of headings and accurate alignment of text but avoid\nstandardised CV templates which reduce the individuality of your document\nThink what recruiters most want to know about you. Give most space and prominence to the\nqualifications and experience that are most relevant. You can find out what some of the\nleading legal recruiters are looking for at http://targetjobs.co.uk/career-sectors/lawsolicitors/applications-and-interviews/skills-graduate-recruiters-at-law-firms-lo.\nLawCareers.net has similar information at\nwww.lawcareers.net/Information/Features/Detail.aspx?r=1269\nTry to show that you can make a positive difference by concentrating on significant outcomes\nfrom work experience and interests rather than listing everything you\xe2\x80\x99ve done\nTry to describe your skills in a way that is appropriate for a particular application. For example,\nall lawyers need strong communication skills but the people you meet as a City lawyer are\ndifferent from the clients in high street practice, so select relevant examples from your own\ncommunication experience\nIt is vital you check everything you have written as even the tiniest of errors will probably mean\nyour application is rejected. You\xe2\x80\x99d kick yourself if all the hours spent on your CV content are\nwasted.\nA structure that suits most applications\nTitle. Putting \xe2\x80\x98Curriculum Vitae\xe2\x80\x99 is old-fashioned, so use your first and last names as the title. If\nyour first name could also be a last name, try putting your last name in bold or a larger font.\nPersonal details. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to use the heading \xe2\x80\x98Personal details\xe2\x80\x99 but you normally include\naddress (and contact address if different); phone number(s) and email address(es) \xe2\x80\x93 but make\nsure they are up to date. Nationality is optional but it is good to show that you have permission to\nwork in the UK if you are not an EEA or British national. If your gender is not obvious from your\nname, you might wish to include it so that recruiters know how to address correspondence to you\nor put in your title (Mr/Ms etc) to make it clear. Make sure this section looks professional by\navoiding email addresses that say too much about your personal life! The Kent careers website\ngives examples of some addresses which might give recruiters the wrong impression!\nwww.kent.ac.uk/careers/cv.htm\nPersonal profile/career objective. A personal profile can work well if you have something very\nspecific that you want to highlight but recruiters don\xe2\x80\x99t like profiles such as \xe2\x80\x98highly motivated,\nambitious law student with excellent communication and team working skills\xe2\x80\x99 that look like\n\n\x0ceveryone else\xe2\x80\x99s and provide no evidence of the skills you claim to have. The sort that might work\nis \xe2\x80\x98Multilingual LLM student with a 1st at undergraduate level and six months\xe2\x80\x99 international legal\nexperience\xe2\x80\xa6..\xe2\x80\x99 in a single sentence this emphasises five things that could interest employers ie\nlanguages, study at Master\xe2\x80\x99s level, excellent academic results, significant work experience and an\ninternational perspective. A career objective might be similar but also mention what you are\nlooking for eg \xe2\x80\x98seeking experience in banking law.\xe2\x80\x99 It is hard to write the kind of profile which will\nreally make you stand out.\nEducation. This could also be entitled \xe2\x80\x98Education and qualifications\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Education and awards.\xe2\x80\x99\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s usual to list qualifications in reverse chronological order, stating degree modules and grades\nas well as A level and GCSE grades. Mention your dissertation either for the relevance of the\ncontent to the firm or for the research, analytical and organisational skills it developed. Use\ncolumns and list A levels or GCSEs in as few lines as possible to save space. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to\nname every GCSE subject but recruiters will be interested in number of A*, A and B grades and\nyou could mention grades (if good) for core subjects such as English, maths and modern\nlanguages. Include any major academic prizes you won in school, college or university. Include\nacademic qualifications only; other qualifications such as IT skills certificates could go into a skills\nsection if relevant.\nLegal experience. List in reverse chronological order and include voluntary work. You can\ninclude attendance at open days and activities like the TARGETchances events as well as work\nexperience. Emphasise your most significant achievements, knowledge gained and skills learned\nrather than listing every single thing you have done and give the most space to significant\nresponsibilities. Use bullet points, be concise and avoid repetition if you have done the same work\non several occasions.\nOther work experience. You may have non-legal experience that is particularly relevant to your\nlegal applications. Examples include commercial experience for commercial law or\nwelfare/advisory work for legal aid or public sector practice. If so, you could make this a separate\nsection. Avoid detailed descriptions of everything you did in casual jobs, but give a brief overview,\ninformation on any unusual achievements, such as rapid promotion or extra responsibility, and\ndescribe transferable skills. While bar work might not seem very relevant, successfully handling\nawkward customers will probably have developed your ability to defuse most difficult situations.\nSkills. Most of your skills will be evident in your descriptions of work experience and\nextracurricular activities, but you might have a short section detailing skills such as IT competence,\nlanguages and driving licence. Different firms will be interested in different languages; those doing\nmultinational business normally like European languages and those relating to other countries in\nwhich they operate, whereas an immigration practice will welcome languages that are relevant to\ntheir clients.\nInterests and achievements. Use a heading that emphasises your particular strengths such as\npositions of responsibility or voluntary work. Think what your activities say about you \xe2\x80\x93 bigger\nfirms of solicitors like sports, other team activities and evidence of outstanding achievement. Aim\nto show yourself as a rounded and interesting person who can manage your time well enough to\ncombine getting a good degree with extra curricular activities. But if you have had to work long\nhours in a part-time job during your degree and this has limited your time for hobbies, don\xe2\x80\x99t be\nafraid to mention this under work experience \xe2\x80\x93 you could just indicate the number of hours you\nwork in an average week\nCV examples\nLook at the CV examples and sample covering letters but don\xe2\x80\x99t be tempted to simply copy either\nstyle or content. Your CV is likely to be the first contact you have with a firm, so take the time to\nproduce the best document possible. Note that larger firms have their own application forms and\nwill not normally accept CVs.\n\n\x0cNasreen Khan\n27 Hillingdon Rise, Uxbridge UB8 2XY\nNaskhan3@brunelmail.co.uk\nFirst year LLB student with legal, administrative and customer service experience, seeking legal\nwork shadow or work experience\n\nEducation\n2011 \xe2\x80\x93 2015 LLB (Hons) Law\nBrunel University, London\n2011 - 2012\nModules: English Legal Institutions and Methods, Contract Law, Public Law\nand Criminal Law\n2009 \xe2\x80\x93 2011\n\nA levels\nHeathland College, Uxbridge\nA2 Sociology (A), A2 History (C), A2 Law (B), AS Economics (B)\n\n2008 \xe2\x80\x93 2009\n\nGCSEs\nParkside School, Uxbridge\n11 subjects: 2 A*, 4A, 3B and 2 C including English Language A*, Maths B\nand Spanish A*\n\nLegal Experience\nJune \xe2\x80\x93 July 2011\n\nAttended County, Magistrates and Crown Court hearings to develop\nknowledge of criminal and civil proceedings\n\nMay 2010\n\nJunior legal assistant\nPrentice, Hall and Parker, Ealing\nLearned office procedures and business communications through\noperating front desk and administrative tasks\nAttended client meetings on family, employment and property matters and\ndiscussed cases with the solicitors\n\nEmployment\nJune \xe2\x80\x93 Aug 2011 Part-time admin assistant ART Group, Slough\nDealt with telephone queries for this mail order business ensuring that\norders were met on time\nCreated and updated a new customer and supplier database which\nrequired close attention to detail\nDeveloped excellent oral communication skills from solving customers\xe2\x80\x99\nproblems and negotiating with suppliers\nPre 2011\n\nRetail experience and voluntary care work with adults with learning difficulties\nhelped me communicate with people from all walks of life\n\nSkills\nConfident user of MS Office including Excel and Access\nFluent in Urdu and Punjabi; taking Spanish lessons\nFull clean UK driving licence\n\n\x0c(Miss) Daljit Sagoo\nTel:\nEmail:\nAddress:\n\n0208 000 0000\nMobile:\nds9@brumail.co.uk\n20 Brunel Way, Uxbridge UB8 3PH\n\n07901 000000\n\nEDUCATION & AWARDS\n2008-2012\n2009\n2009\n\n2001-2008\n2008\n2006\n\nBrunel University, Uxbridge\nLLB (Hons) Law \xe2\x80\x93 achieved high 2:1 in level 2\nContract Law (B) English Legal Institutions and Methods (B)\nCriminal Law (B) and Public Law (A)\nCompany Law (A), Competition Law (A) Law of the European\nUnion (B) Tort Law (B) Employment Law (A)\n\nSouthlands High School, Wandsworth\nA levels: Business Studies (A) English Literature (B) Computing (B)\nAwarded Greenhow Prize for Business\nGCSEs: 7 at grade A/A* incl.
